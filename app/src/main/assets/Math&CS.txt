This informed search algorithm was first described in 1968 by Hart, Nilsson, and Raphael. It uses a
heuristic, an estimate of a node's distance from the endpoint, to reduce computation time. It is similar
to greedy best-first search, but will always produce (*) optimal paths, as long as an admissible heuristic
is used, since it takes into account the distance already travelled in its calculations. It is an extension of
Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a special case of this algorithm when the heuristic is always zero. This search
algorithm that maintains an open set of nodes that are scheduled to be traversed, and a closed set of already
visited nodes. For 10 points, name this frequently used algorithm used for pathfinding, with variants such as
a hierarchical version often used for road navigation, and B* [B-star].

The Wronskian of homogenous solutions of a second order differential equation are related to the

The category of these entities contains a faithful functor to the category of sets that has no right
adjoint, but whose left adjoint associates a "free" one of these entities to its basis set. If they contain
no non-identity elements that have finite order, they are called torsion-free, and the sum of two
homomorphisms between two of these entities is also a homomorphism. The fundamental theorem of
these structures states that finitely-generated ones can be decomposed into a direct sum of (*) cyclic
groups with prime-power order. The centralizers of these entities are equivalent to these entities in their

Like the identity function, the antiderivative of this function equals half its output times x plus the constant
of integration. This function is equivalent to multiplying by the signum [SIG-num] function, and its
application to sums gives a result very similar to the triangle inequality. Its complex analogue is the
modulus, giving the magnitude of a quantity. Name this function that when graphed produces a v shape,
which multiplies negative numbers by negative one and has no effect on positive numbers.
ANSWER: absolute value
This function can be generalized to vector spaces in the form of a norm, and for complex numbers is
called the modulus. The derivative of this function is the signum function, which is not defined at

ANSWER: absolute value function (accept complex modulus before "modulus")
Ling slightly simplified one form of this circuit by factoring out a propagate term from the group
generate signal despite it not being a common factor. That form of this circuit helps eliminate the gate delay
of the ripple-carry type of this circuit. A basic implementation of it feeds the two main bits into an XOR
gate and an AND gate, sends the output of that XOR gate, along with a C-sub-in bit, to another XOR
gate/AND gate pair and ORs the output of the AND gates together. A naive implementation of this circuit
eliminates all but the first XOR and AND gate from the aforementioned design; that is the "half" type,
which does not support a carry-in bit. For 10 points, identify these basic blocks used in arithmetic logic
units which sum binary inputs.
ANSWER: adder [accept summer before "sum" is read]
When performing this action on any two numbers a2 and nb2, the result is closed under multiplication by
Brahmagupta's identity. The "general coproducts" in category theory are one of the most abstract
generalizations of this and the "maximum operation" in set theory is a dequantized version of this.
Integration over a zero-dimensional manifold reduces to this, and this operation is applied to each term of
the Taylor polynomial for ex. To apply this operation on two vectors, the "tail to tip" method can be used,

The ABC conjecture considers three numbers such that the largest is this function of the other two,
and this operation applied to the Mobius functions of all divisors of a given integer yields zero. The
degree of a multivariate polynomial is equal to the largest value of this operation applied to the

"parallelogram rule." A capital sigma can denote repeated applications of it, and 0 is the identity of this
operation. For ten points, identify this operation which yields a sum, symbolized by a plus sign.
ANSWER: addition (or summation before mentioned)
In category theory, this concept is generalized by the coproduct, and its analogue in set theory is the disjoint
union. Performing this operation on several vector spaces gives the smallest vector space containing each of
the original vector spaces. For two vectors, it can be visualized using the parallelogram rule. Repeated
application of this operation is denoted by a capital sigma. It is commutative and associative, and
multiplication distributes over it. For 10 points, name this arithmetic operation, the inverse of subtraction.
ANSWER: addition or summation
Brahmagupta's identity states that performing this operation on two square numbers results in a closed set
under multiplication. This operation is repeatedly performed on terms in the Taylor polynomial for the
hyperbolic cosine function, and the tip-to-tail method or the parallelogram method is used when performing
this operation on two or more vectors. Performing this operation on a sequence of numbers turns it into a
series, which is represented with an uppercase sigma. For 10 points, name this mathematical operation that
is the inverse of subtraction.

A logic circuit that conducts this operation consists of two inputs put into an XOR and AND gate. This
operation can be easily performed on vectors by using the parallelogram rule. When this operation is
performed on two rational numbers of the form a over b and c over d, it yields a d plus b c over b d. A
series is defined using a capital sigma, which represents repeated applications of this operation. The
identity element for this operation is zero. For 10 points, identify this mathematical operation represented

A hypothesis about these numbers posits that the exponential of a singular strong limit one equals its
successor; that hypothesis is a consequence of a certain generalized hypothesis about these numbers
which with ZF implies the axiom of choice. In ZFC, if one sequence of these is termwise less than
another sequence of these, then the sum of the first sequence is strictly less than the product of the
second sequence, according to Konig's theorem. Multiplying one of these numbers by itself yields the
(*) same number. The Schroeder-Bernstein theorem demonstrates the existence of a total order on these
numbers, which are indexed by , an extension of a theorem which only defines a strict order; that theorem is
due to Cantor. For 10 points, name these numbers that are cardinals, used to represent the size of infinite

The Heyting type of this structure is studied in logic, while the universal enveloping one is described by the
Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem. A Hopf one of these is a unital associative one together with an
antiautomorphism, and von Neumann ones arise in quantum mechanics. Sigma ones are used to define

ANSWER: algebra
One of these constructs defined on the reals is used to generate a probability distribution of a random

varieties; those constructs refer to collections of sets over which measures are defined and are denoted by
the letter sigma. This word also refers to numbers that are roots of non-zero polynomials with rational

polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root according to the fundamental theorem
of this discipline. For 10 points, name this discipline, the manipulation and solving of variables.
ANSWER: algebra
A vector space employing a namesake bracket is called a Lie one. Integral domains, groups and rings are

science term for a finite set of procedures for solving a problem.
ANSWER: Algorithms
Functions of this type in several variables are governed by Hartog's lemma, and Szabo's theorem and the
Ostrowski-Hadamard gap theorem provide obstructions to extending the domain of such functions, while
techniques like the Schwartz reflection principle make such extension possible. Morera's theorem, a
criterion for showing that a function has this property, is a converse to Cauchy's theorem, which states that
states the line integral of one of these functions around a simply connected region is zero. For 10 points,

ANSWER: analytic functions [or holomorphic functions; do not accept or prompt on "meromorphic"]
A function with specified zeros and specified orders of those zeros that also has this property exists as a
consequence of the Weierstrass Product Theorem. According to a theorem of Liouville, a function that is
bounded and has this property everywhere must be constant. A function that has this property on a closed
region may be expanded in a Laurent series within that region, and that function has this property if it
satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations within that region. The real parts of functions with this property are
harmonic, and a function may fail to have this property in the complex plane due to the presence of poles or
branch cuts. For 10 points, identify this property of a complex-valued function, which is equivalent to being

these figures formed by two rays with the same endpoint.
ANSWER: angles
In a circle, this distance equals the radius minus the sagitta of a chord, which equals the distance from the
center of the circle to the midpoint of that chord. For other shapes, this equals the side length divided by

Even though he credited somebody else for it, the property named for this person states that, given any real

When these structures have three consecutive perfect squares, they use a multiple of twenty-four, and a

This data type is the output of PHP's "explode" and Perl's "split" command. To simulate stacks, this data
type can be input into Perl's "push" and "pop" methods. Segments can be cut out of this data structure via
splicing. Hash tables can be used to implement an associative version, and in C++, this structure is iterated
to simulate a multidimensional version. An "out of bound" exception can be thrown in Java when working
with these structures, whose length minus one is its largest index. For ten points, name this linear data
structure in which variables are indexed starting at zero.
ANSWER: array
Special types of these include ones that are indexed by non-integer values or begin at index 1 and
stores children at 2n and 2n+1, and are known as hash tables and heaps, respectively. Addressing in
this structure uses (*) pointers to refer to a specific memory address. A one-dimensional one of these can
also be known as a vector. For 10 points, name this data structure, analogous to the matrix in mathematics,
which stores multiple elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.
ANSWER: array
In php, this kind of variable is the output of the explode function. This kind of data structure is
being probed during quadratic probing and linear probing, which are used to resolve collisions when
using hash functions. Doubling the capacity of these items during resizing can be used to show that
insertion and deletion from them is performed in amortized constant time. The associative type of
this data structure is actually a map of key and value pairs. C style (*) strings are basically these data
structures filled with chars. Like pointers, they are allocated in many languages using the asterisk operator.
For 10 points, name these linear data structures which are accessed using square brackets, and which can be
thought of as one-dimensional matrices.
ANSWER: arrays
In hash map implementations, quadratic and linear probing techniques move along one of these
data structures until free space is found. Dynamic forms of this data structure often double their size
when they reach a certain threshold value and are implemented with namesake lists in Java. Jagged
forms of these objects have a rank greater than 1. Dictionaries that store a key and a value are
sometimes called (*) associative forms of these data structures. These data structures provide constant time
lookup and insertion operations. In Java, square brackets are used to find a value in these data structures at
a given index. For 10 points, name these data structures that contain an ordered list of objects in contigous
memory.
ANSWER: Arrays
A dope vector often contains information about the extents and stride properties of these data structures,
while the packed variety store multiple data elements in one memory word. In practice, random access in
these data structures can be slowed down because of poor locality of reference when caches are used,
although elements can be asymptotically accessed in Big O of 1 time. Row-major order is often used to
implement multi-dimensional ones, and Edsger Dijikstra argued for starting their indeces at 0. FTP, name
this simple data structure often implemented by declaring a variable with brackets.
ANSWER: Arrays
The off-by-one error is commonly encountered when writing to these entities. Character strings can be
represented as these entities with a trailing null byte, and the lack of bound checking on these structures can
result in the overwriting of memory addresses. In C and C++, these entities are defined using square
brackets, and in most languages, their indices start at zero. For 10 points, name these data structures that
contain elements of the same data type, which can be two-dimensional and are thus analogous to matrices.
ANSWER: arrays
The Judy algorithm can be used to define a very fast version of these data structures by combining them
with features of a hash, and a Vlist combines them with linked lists. Indexing in these structures occurs in
big omega of 1 time and have zero wasted space, while resizable ones are referred to as dynamic. Slicing is
a method for removing a part of these data structures and putting them into a smaller one, and these
structures can be declared by declaring a series of dimensions after the name of a variable. Usually used
with for loops and to implement tables, for 10 points, identify these matrix-like data structures, a group of
variables with the same name but different indices.
ANSWER: array
Elements can be extracted from this data structure in a process called slicing. When most of the values
are zero, this data structure is said to be sparse. A hash table is the most common way to implement the
associative type of this data structure, which associates an arbitrary key with a value. These data structures
are indexed according to pointer arithmetic. When one-dimensional, these data structures are called vectors,
and they usually contain elements of only one data type. Identify these data structures analogous to
matrices that store data in a contiguous address space.
ANSWER: arrays
Unlike a linked list, this data structure does not require memory for references; elements are addressed
adding a base memory address to the product of a fixed increment and the index. A one-dimensional one is
considered to be linear. One of these stores multiple elements of the same type in continguous memory
locations. For 10 points, name this data structure, analogous to the mathematical matrix.
ANSWER: array
Control tables are a type of this object used to avoid explicit branch statements. Bounds-checking
can spot common compile time exceptions using these objects, and implementation of "sparse"
varieties avoid allocating memory for default values. These objects can be dynamically resized so
that insertions at the end require amortized constant time, and a description of this object is often
held in a dope vector. These objects are used when locality of reference is important, so that (*)
pointer arithmetic is often used to access these data structures, which are numbered starting with zero.
Unlike a similar data type this structure supports random access. For 10 points, name this data structure
which, like a linked list, contains a number of elements in order.
ANSWER: Array
This data structure implements hash tables, stacks, and queues (KYOOZ). "Packed" ones store multiple
contiguous elements in one word. Associative ones can have strings for indices. These structures may be
replaced by linked lists so that they can grow and shrink, and a naive search method on this structure
succeeds in linear time. For 10 points, name this linear data structure in which each element can be accessed
by its index.
ANSWER: arrays
In low-level languages, these data structures are often described by dopes, which can be used to
create new data structures of this type in a process called slicing. Examples of these objects that have
low cache misses are named for Douglas Haskins' sister Judy. The stride of these data structures
gives the distance in memory between successive entries. A map or dictionary is sometimes referred
to as an (*) associative form of this data structure, as elements are indexed by keys rather than a zero-based
integer. These objects have big-O of 1 lookup and storage time. Two-dimensional ones can be represented
by a matrix. A for loop often iterates through them. For 10 points, name these simple data structures often
declared using square brackets.
ANSWER: array
When these data structures have a low stride they are stored contiguously in memory, which
increases throughput. One of these objects is created after determining the min and max of the items
to be sorted when implementing counting sort. A form of these objects are implemented using either
row-major or column-major order, and full heaps can efficiently be stored using one of these data
structures. Dynamic forms of these data structures allow for their size to be increased while still
maintaining close to the (*) constant time needed to read and write from them. Multi-dimensional forms of
this data structure can be used to represent matrices, and they are often iterated through using for loops. For
10 points, name this simple data structure declared using square brackets in languages with C syntax.
ANSWER: multi-dimensional arrays
These structures are called sparse if they are mostly filled with zeros. When each element of these
structures contains another of these structures, they are called jagged. In Java, these data structures may
exist as hybrid "Lists", in which case they can be heterogeneous. When two-dimensional, these objects are
often called matrices, while one-dimensional ones are called vectors. For 15 points, name these ordered,
linear collections of data often represented with square brackets.

One argument against the primary test of this concept is Searle's (SER-ul) Chinese room argument.
Distributed versions of this concept are implemented using multi-agent systems. This term was first coined
by John McCarthy. A popular technique in this field can use backpropagation (back-prop-uh-gay-shun).
Programmers in this field often use LISP. One of the more popular techniques in this branch of computer
science is neural networks. For 10 points, name this branch of computer science that attempts to create
"thinking" machines.
ANSWER: AI [or artificial intelligence; accept neural networks due to ambiguities]
Philosopher John Searle first delineated the strong and weak types of this concept. Edward Feigenbaum
developed expert systems, which can be used to simulate this. This field, whose name was coined by John
McCarthy, often makes use of the Lisp programming language and concepts like fuzzy logic. Perceptrons
are among the different types of neural networks used to simulate this concept. For 10 points, identify this
field of computer science involving problems like machine learning, knowledge representation, and
simulating human brains.
ANSWER: artificial intelligence [or AI]
One application of this field is the creation of expert systems. The "strong" form of this was attacked by
Searle in the Chinese Room Argument. Techniques used to create it include neural networks. Applications
of it include natural language processing and computer vision. The ultimate benchmark in this field is the
Turing test, in which a person attempts, by conversation, to tell a person apart from a computer. For 10
points, identify this area of research in computer science, which attempts to create software and robots that
emulate human mental function.
ANSWER: artificial intelligence [or AI]
One of this phenomenon's namesake "winters" is thought to have been caused by Marvin Minsky's
work on perceptrons. Expert systems using fuzzy logic can imitate this phenomenon described by
Prolog and Lisp. John Searle attacked the "strong" form of this phenomenon in a thought
experiment involving a man who uses a dictionary to manipulate information slid under a door,
called the [*] Chinese Room experiment. ELIZA does not pass the Turing test, which is used to study this
phenomenon. Machine learning and knowledge representation are key parts of, for 10 points, what field of
computer science that seeks to emulate the function of the human brain?
ANSWER: artificial intelligence
The Moufang identities closely resemble this property, but they do not imply it. If the subalgebra
generated by any element of an algebra has this property, the algebra has the "power" form of this
property. A magma with this property is a semigroup. The octonions lack this property, but the
quaternions and the complex numbers possess it. An algebraic structure that possesses an (*) identity
element, an inverse element, closure, and this property is a group. Along with distributivity, matrix
multiplication possesses this property. For 10 points, name this property of a binary operation which for
multiplication means quantity ab times c equals a times quantity bc.
ANSWER: associativity [or associative, do not under any circumstances accept or prompt on "associated with"]
The operation in a semigroup must follow this property, and a weak form of this is its power type. In Lie
[lee] algebras, the Jacobi [jah-KOBE-ee] identity is used instead of this property. While this property does
hold for matrix multiplication, it does not hold for subtraction. This is used in problems involving the same
operation at least twice. This changes the order of the application of the operations in contrast with
demonstrating commutativity [kuh-MYOOT-uh-ti-vi-tee]. Name this operation that says a+b+c has the same
value even when you change the placement of parentheses.
ANSWER: associativity (accept associative property)
Though not a bar, this symbol can denote the complex conjugate of a matrix. In C and C++, this
symbol is used to declare a pointer variable, while in Ruby and Python, two of these symbols are used
to express (*) exponents. It denotes a wildcard character in Unix, and this symbol can be used after a
forward slash to begin block comments in most programming languages. On a normal keyboard, shift-8
yields, for ten points, which symbol that looks like a star and is often used as a multiplication sign?
ANSWER: asterisks (prompt on star or similar)
One form of this term can be found by taking the limit of f(x) divided by x as x goes to a, then using
that limit to take the limit of f(x) minus the limit times x. They can also be found by taking the
quotient when the numerator of a rational function is divided by its denominator. One of these not
parallel to the x or y axes is known as the oblique type; the function y equals x plus one over x has
one at y equals x. There are also vertical and horizontal forms of them; the vertical form exists if the
limit of a function as it approaches a point a from either direction is equal to positive or negative infinity.
For 10 points, name this term that describes a line a function will get infinitely close to.
ANSWER: asymptote
The adjectival form of this word is applied to curves or lines on ruled surfaces where there is no curvature.
That form can also be used for big O [oh] notation, since it classifies algorithms by the type of this created
by its limiting behavior. Though graphs of rational functions are limited to only one horizontal example of
this structure, there are two of them for some functions such as arctangent. The vertical type exists for
rational functions with non-removable discontinuities, and the only non-degenerate conic section to be
associated with these is the hyperbola. Name these lines that graphs approach as they go towards infinity.
ANSWER: asymptotes or asymptotic
On a phase portrait, the eigenvectors serve as these, and spiral points may be stable with respect to them.
These act as essential discontinuities, in contrast with "removable" and "jump" discontinuities. Their slope
equals plus or minus b over a for a hyperbola in standard form. The graph of the arctangent x or of a logistic
curve will have two of these. "Oblique" or "slant" ones occur when the degree of the numerator of a rational
function is greater than the degree of the denominator. The limit of a function as x goes to infinity or
negative infinity is the "horizontal" one. For 10 points, name these imaginary lines which functions
approach but do not cross.
ANSWER: asymptotes [or vertical asymptotes; or horizontal asymptotes; or slant asymptotes; or oblique asymptotes]
An early proof for this problem involved the use of a Taylor series employing the sin function and the
length of an arc on the unit circle. It can be solved using the s equals 2 case of the Riemann (*) zeta
function. It was first proposed by Mengoli and popularized by Jakob Bernoulli. It solution was determined
to be pi squared over six. For 10 points, name this mathematical problem solved by Euler and named after a
Swiss city, which asks for the sum of the reciprocals of the perfect squares.
ANSWER: Basel problem
In functional analysis, two types of this concept differ in whether they allow for infinite sums or not;
those are the Schauder and Hamel types. Given a set of this type in a function's target space, the
function is continuous if and only if the preimage of every element of this set is open. A free module is
a module equipped with a set of this type. Taking unions of elements from this set yields all (*)
elements of a topology. An algorithm for modifying a set of this type forms an element "u sub n" by taking
"v sub n" and subtracting the projections of each previous "u sub i" onto "v sub n;" that orthonormalization
is called the Gram-Schmidt process. The "standard" one for Rn ("R-n") is the set of unit vectors, and the
number of elements in this set equals the dimension of a vector space. For 10 points, give this term for a set
of linearly independent vectors that span a vector space.
ANSWER: basis
The Hamel type and Schauder type of this mathematical obejct differ in the cardinality of allowed
combinations. SVD algorithms relate one of these to a diagonal matrix, while the spectral theorem
allows the decomposition into one of these constructed from eigenvectors. The Fourier transform is
equivalent to changing between the (*) position type and the momentum type of these objects. Zorn's
lemma can show every vector space is entitled to one of these, and any linearly independent set can be
extended into one. For 10 points, name this class of mathematical objects, a linearly independent set of
vectors spanning some space.
ANSWER: basis
A double exponential time algorithm for making these structures creates them from generators for a
polynomial ideal and was developed by Buchberger. A theorem named for these objects states that
every ideal in a polynomial ring defined over a Noetherian ring is finitely generated. In abstract
algebra, one type of this structure is named for Wolfgang Grobner. Transition matrices of a (*)
vector space are used to transform between these objects. When given a maximum set of inputs, the GramSchmidt process will output an orthogonal type of this mathematical structure. An example of one of these
functions for the space of cubic polynomials consists of 1,x, x squared, and x cubed. For 10 points, name
these spanning sets whose elements are linearly independent.

This mathematician is the namesake of both a directed acyclic graphical model that can be used in medical
diagnosis and a method of inference used to determine how well a variety of hypotheses align with
experimental results leading to a posterior probability distribution. His namesake theorem shows why a
small number of false positives can cast a strong doubt on all positive results and can be derived using
either a Venn diagram showing the four possible regions created by two dependent events or by a tree
diagram with four terminal nodes. Name this mathematician who in a posthumously published paper
designed a theorem expressing the probability of A given B in terms of the probabilities of A, B, and B
given A.
ANSWER: Thomas Bayes
Maximum entropy techniques are an alternative to a methodology named after him, which suggests that
probability parameters themselves have probability distributions. When a maximum likelihood estimator is
used in conjugation with a certain type of information, the estimator converges to a type named for this
man. In a paradigm named for him the true moment of the population is altered as new experiments are
performed, in contrast with the frequentist approach which assumes constant moments for a population. He
developed a theorem which relates the posterior probability of an event to the prior probability of the
individual events. A technique named for him is used to filter spam messages. For 10 points, identify this
early English statistician who wrote "An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances."
ANSWER: Thomas Bayes
This man's namesake estimator is identical to the maximum likelihood estimator if the
parameters to both are uniform. A mathematical structure named for this scientist can be
interpreted using Gibbs sampling and is a directed acyclic graph that represents conditional
dependencies of variables. A statement named for this man is often proved by invoking the
commutative property of set intersection. In addition to naming a kind of network, this man names a
paradigm that stands in contrast to the (*) frequentist approach, in which the prior probability is
completely rejected. His namesake theorem relates the conditional probabilities of various events and is
often used in detecting spam. For 10 points, name this 18th century English statistician.
ANSWER: Thomas Bayes
A variational application of this statement relies on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The
Jeffries distribution, which is based on the Fischer information, is often used in conjunction with this
statement, and a method named after this statement is a hypothesis testing method that is an alternative to
the Fischer and Neyman-Pearson methods. In conjunction with a Dirichlet distribution, this statement can be
used to model allele frequencies, and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are based on this theorem, while
another popular application of it is spam filtering. For 10 points, name this theorem of probability which
says that the posterior is proportional to the likelihood times the prior.
ANSWER: Bayes' Theorem [accept reasonable equivalents that include "Bayes"]
Pierre-Simon Laplace began his 1774 memoirs with a version of this statement. Fisher praised this
idea's original formulator for not making it public, leaving it to Richard Price to publish. Harold Jeffreys
revived interest in it, and offered it as an alternative to confidence intervals and other frequentist
approaches. For ten points, name this statement of probability that relates a posterior probability to a prior
and likelihood function, named for an English mathematician.
ANSWER: Bayes' theorem [or Bayes' law]
Dempsey and Shafer developed a generalization of this theorem, which provides the basis for
hierarchical modeling of transcription factors. In a Hidden Markov Model, the forward-backward
algorithm uses this theorem to combine the forward and backward observations. Belief networks are
based on this theorem, which is often used to find the credible interval and is avoided by (*)
frequentists. Applying this theorem yields the interesting result that it's always beneficial to switch doors in
the Monty Hall Problem. It states that the prior probability times the likelihood divided by a normalizer is
equal to the conditional probability of an event. For 10 points, name this fundamental theorem of
probability named for a British minister.
ANSWER: Bayes- Theorem
Cromwell's rule limits the cases where this theorem can be applied. This theorem is used to find
the credibility interval. This theorem is used by the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, and can
also be used to solve the Monty Hall Problem. The CRM114 program uses a Markov Field to
improve upon results obtained with this theorem in spam filtering. This theorem is used to calculate
the posterior (*) probability, and relates the actual probability of an event to the measured probability in a
test. For 10 points, name this theorem which allows probability to change upon the acquisition of new
evidence and is written as the probability of A given B equals probability of B given A times probability of
A over probability of B.
ANSWER: Bayes- theorem [or Bayes- law]
In March 2011, Joy Christian claimed to have disproved this theorem by applying it to a system on a
hypersphere. The original paper deriving this theorem uses an epsilon-delta proof to show that 2
forms of the expected value of the product of 2 quantities are not equal. A switch determines which
electro-acoustical transducer activates and disturbs a pool of water in an experiment testing this
theorem. The CHSH inequality uses the fact that the quantum correlation of 2 variables must be
between 2 and -2 to test this theorem that was originally proposed in terms of two particles being measured
using Stern-Gerlach Magnets. Based off of the EPR paradox, this is, for 10 points, what inequality which
states that no local hidden variables theory is physically accurate.

Wide Web.
ANSWER: Tim Berners-Lee
One person with this last name is the namesake of the coefficients of the Taylor series for x over the
quantity e to the x minus 1 centered at x = 0. Another person with this last name lends his name to a theory
along with Euler that gives an equation governing the transverse deflection of a beam as a function of its
flexural rigidity and the applied load. The former lends his name to a process in which the outcomes of
independent experiments can only be "successes" and "failures" with fixed probability, exemplified by a
coin toss. The latter lends his name to an analog of the conservation of energy that describes inviscid flow.

essential to constructing search queries.
ANSWER: Boolean logic
Donald Benson provided an elementary solution to it in a horizontal frame using Cauchy's inequality, and
the absence of an explicit x term results in a simplified version that can be solved by the Beltrami identity.
An approach analogous to optics invokes Fermat's Principle and Snell's Law, which was employed by
Johann Bernoulli, while Leibniz, Newton, and L'Hopital solved it using the calculus of variations. For 10
points, identify this problem which seeks the path connecting two points on which an object can slide under
the influence of gravity in "least time."
ANSWER: Brachistochrone problem
A "bidirectional" variation of this algorithm passes through the list twice per iteration and is also called
"shuttle" or "cocktail," and "odd-even" sort is a parallel-processing optimized alteration; the first method
eliminates the problem of small elements at the big-element end, which are called "turtles" since they
uniquely must travel the full length of the list. For 10 points, name this naive big-oh-of-n-squared sorting
algorithm, in which repeated passes are made swapping adjacent out-of-order elements, such that the small
elements float to the top.
ANSWER: bubble sort
The more efficient bidirectional variant of this algorithm, which reverses the direction after each pass, is
referred to by the term "cocktail shaker". Another optimization is to terminate if no swaps occur during a
pass. It's not insertion sort, but for n items it approaches a time complexity of Big O of n for mostly sorted
data. However, it has a quadratic runtime in the worst case and is less efficient than insertion and selection
sort in practice. This algorithm works by comparing adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the
wrong order. For 10 points name this sorting algorithm which is named for the way that elements move up
the list.
ANSWER: bubble sort [accept: sinking sort]
This kind of sort belongs to the order of n squared, making it inefficient for large data sets, although it is
both stable and adaptive. The list elements subject to it only go through a comparison algorithm obeying
transitivity and trichotomy. For presorted lists, it is better than many sorts like quicksort, but still not as
good as insertion sort. For 10 points, name the sorting algorithm that stops after a complete run through a
set causes no elements to float to one end or the other.
ANSWER: bubble sort [or sinking sort]
These entities are reduced or eliminated by increasing the size of the community according to
Linus- Law. Hard-to-find examples of these entities are given a pun on Werner Heisenberg's name.
It's not style, but one approach to reducing the frequency of these entities is to use static analysis
tools. These entities are typically checked for after the implementation stage in the waterfall model.
GDB is a type of program named for discovering these entities that supports operations like step-in

They're checked for through unit testing, and famous examples include the Y2K one. For 10 points, name
these defects in a computer program.

The tcsh shell is named after this language due to its similar syntax. Dynamic memory allocation is done
in this language with the use of malloc. This language's "string" is commonly used to denote a string that is
null-terminated. The authoritative book on this language, often abbreviated K&R, was written by Brian
Kernighan and this language's developer, Dennis Ritchie, who created it while at Bell Labs. For 10 points,
identify this most widely-used and influential programming language.
ANSWER: C
This is often said to be a language that "makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot." There are many
versions of it, but the most recent is the 99 implementation. It stemmed from a stripped-down version of
BCPL and was developed for a PDP-11 machine. Known as a weakly-typed language, it lacks support for
generic programming and exception handling. Thus, object-oriented practices are very difficult to
implement in this language. However, people still consider it to be fast, efficient, and versatile due to its
low-level capabilities, though it still has many security vulnerabilities, most notably its lack of boundchecking for arrays. FTP, name this programming language that was developed for UNIX and has
influenced the development of most modern programming languages.
ANSWER: C (Do NOT accept C++, C#, etc.)
This language has recently been updated to allow for move semantics, although the syntax for it is so
complex that no compiler has successfully implemented it. Software engineers probably have read Scott
Meyer's book on this language, in which you can specify abstract classes by setting their virtual functions
equal to 0. Like Perl and Python, you can use multiple inheritance in this language. The rule of 3 applies to
this language, stating that if any one of a destructor, copy constructor, or assignment operator must be
explicitly defined, then they all must be. To print and input something in this language, you may use "c out"
and "c in." This language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup and incorporates a unary operator into its
name that indicates it improves upon a certain procedural language. For 10 points, name this object-oriented
extension to C.
ANSWER: C++ or "C plus plus" [do not accept or prompt on "C"]
Critics often argue that this multi-paradigm language allows programmers to mix object-oriented
programming with procedural functions, though its successor only follows the former paradigm. Its
successor has automatic garbage collection, but this language requires explicit cleanup of memory. This
language has notoriously finicky pointers, since it uses value semantics by default and has no safeguards in
place as Java does. For 10 points, name this general-purpose programming language developed by Bell
Labs, a successor to C with a similar name.
ANSWER: C++ ("C plus plus") [do not accept "C"]
The next version of this language has the designation 0x (zero x). One important part of this language is
templates and it supports references. One can manage memory in it by using the delete and new operators.
In it, one can print to the standard output using cout. Unlike its ancestor, this language supports classes. For
10 points, name this programming language whose name reflects that it is a step up from its predecessor, C.
ANSWER: C++
Linus Torvalds once criticized this language on the grounds that some of its features promoted bad practice.
One extension he mentioned, Boost, adds capabilities in mathematics, image processing, and operating
system interaction, and provides a way to do template metaprogramming. Name mangling is used by this
language to implement polymorphism, and printing to StdOut in this language is done with "c-out" followed
by two angle brackets. For 10 points, name this programming language designed by Bjarne Stroustrup, once
known as C with Classes.
ANSWER: C++ [accept C with Classes before end; do not accept "C"]
To make this language easier to parse with LALR(1), the "Significantly Prettier and Easier Syntax" for it
was developed. Created by Bell Labs employee Bjarne Stoustrup, Borland offers a popular "Builder"
program for compiling this language. Unlike a rival developed by Sun, this unmanaged language allows for
multiple inheritance, and it builds on its predecessor by supporting operator overloading in its newly
introduced classes. FTP name this popular Object Oriented programming language, a rival of Java which
built upon C.
ANSWER: C++ [prompt on "New C" or "C with Classes"]
Many of the features in the most recent version of this programming language's standard were
incorporated from Boost, a set of libraries for this language. The most recent version of this
programming language's standard added support for range-based for loops and lambda functions.
The object-oriented aspects of this language were inspired by () Simula. I/O is supported in this language
through streams, with the "c-out" object representing the standard output stream. For 10 points, name this
programming language, which was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 and was originally called "C with
Classes".
ANSWER: C++ [do NOT accept or prompt on "C"]
Its template metaprogramming features allow programmers to write programs that solve problems at
compile-time, if extremely inefficiently. Most notably, it supports multiplate inheritance and operator
overloading, and has a powerful Standard Template Library. For ten points, name this primarily objectoriented programming language, invented by Bjarne Stroustrup, with a name that implies that it is one better
than its predecessor.
ANSWER: C++
This device is first used in Model 85 of the IBM System/360 product line. It is often used hierarchically,
with architectures ranging from strictly inclusive to exclusive. They can range from fully associative over
N-way associative to direct mapped, with the fully associative versions often smaller in size and direct
mapped versions larger because of production cost issues. A benchmark of it is its miss rate, which is
roughly inversely proportional with its size. Replacement of data can be least recently used for the direct
mapped versions, but is often random for fully associative versions. Modern CPUs have several levels of it,
ranging from L1, L2 to sometimes even L3, and it can be several MB in size. FTP, name this device used to
store temporary data for faster write and retrieval.
ANSWER: Cache
One type of this component uses tag blocks to do line matching, while a writing scheme in them
directly bypasses them and is known as no-write-allocate. The unified type of this component
contains both program data and instructions and is often located off-chip, and code can be optimized
for them by exploiting (*) temporal and spatial locality. Replacement schemes for them can involve an
LRU which evicts a victim block that was least recently used, and they can also be Direct-Mapped, FullyAssociative or N-Way Set Associative. For 10 points, name this component of memory that acts as a faster
and smaller duplicate of larger and slower memory.
ANSWER: Caches
A translation lookaside buffer is one of these things used to improve the translation of virtual
addresses. The consistency of data stored in these thing is their namesake "coherence." Those located
on a CPU die are known as (*) L1, L2 or L3. Requesting data from these things can result in a namesake
"hit" or "miss." For 10 points, identify this term which can also refer to the temporary storage used for
HTML pages and images when browsing the web.
ANSWER: cache
Some of these make use of the Illinois Protocol, which is one of many algorithms that make use of the
four words "modified," "shared," "exclusive" and "invalid" in order to prevent the "false sharing" problem
inherent in these devices when trying to maintain their coherency. When implementing the write-back ones
of these, an extra dirty bit is needed to maintain them. They can be direct mapped or set-associative at
times, which allows them to hold more types of data. These devices exploit both temporal locality and
spatial locality. For 10 points, identify these devices that store recently used bits of memory in order to
speed up future access.
ANSWER: caches
The coherence of these entities is maintained in many systems by the MESI protocol, as well as by such
processes as snooping and snarfing. An example of these entities used to map virtual and physical address
spaces is known the translation lookaside buffer. Those used by the CPU are generally divided into the
levels L1 and L2, and they use write-back or write-through allocation. For 10 points, identify these
structures that use the principle of locality to optimize memory efficiency.
ANSWER: caches
These devices displaced slide rules. One company developed the RPL programming language to
work with these devices, which they normally designed to use reverse Polish notation, as in their 12c,
35 and 48 models. That company was Hewlett-Packard. The first of these devices that was able to (*)
plot a function was introduced by Casio. For 10 points, identify these devices manufactured and designed
by Texas Instruments that come in "graphing" types.
ANSWER: electronic calculators [or Computer Algebra System graphing calculators]
The work of Cavalieri and Barrow provided the groundwork for this field of study. George Berkley

Gottfried Leibniz. The other person who discovered this mathematical subject was Sir Isaac Newton. For
10 points, name this branch of mathematics involving the taking of integrals and derivatives.
ANSWER: infinitesimal calculus [prompt on math]
A version of this field originated from the "circle method", or yenri, of Seki Kowa. A satirical work
addressed to Edmund Halley was sharply critical of this field; that work is The Analyst by George
Berkeley. One creator of this field referred to it as the method of fluents and fluxions, and another thinker
developed this field as the study of infinitesimals. For ten points, name this branch of mathematics,
independently discovered by Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton, whose operations include differentiation
and integration.
ANSWER: infinitesimal calculus [accept more specific answers, prompt on mathematics]
This concept was criticized in The Analyst by Bishop Berkeley (BARK-lee), who mocked its "ghosts of
departed quantities." One discoverer of this concept notated it through fluxions, while another used
differential notation. For 10 points, name this branch of mathematics that both Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac
Newton claimed to have discovered.
ANSWER: the infinitesimal calculus
Abraham Robinson created a "non-standard" basis for this field as an alternative to Cauchy's
delta-epsilon version. The book The Analyst attacks the foundations of this field, calling its main theoretical
components "velocities of evanescent increments" and "ghosts of departed quantities." That work by
George Berkeley attacked the Method of Fluxions, whose author feuded with Leibniz over credit for
discovery. For ten points, name this branch of mathematics that uses derivatives and integrals.
ANSWER: calculus [or analysis]
One branch of mathematics with this name uses alpha conversion, beta reduction, and nu conversion. That
system, developed by Stephen Kleene and Alonzo Church, is also named for the abstraction operator
lambda. Another branch of mathematics with this name, also called vector analysis, uses the del operator to
represent the curl and divergence operators. That branch also uses the Frenet-Serret [freh-nay sair-ay]
formulas to relate the binormal, normal, and tangent vectors. The best known branch of mathematics with
this name uses limits to define its central concepts. Name this branch of mathematics that uses integrals and
derivatives.
ANSWER: calculus [accept lambda calculus or vector calculus or multivariable calculus or differential calculus or integral calculus]
One type of this field, arising from a problem proposed by Johann Bernoulli (ber-NOO-lee), is the one
"of variations." This field solves Zeno's dichotomy paradox by showing that the distances traveled are
equivalent to a convergent series, as an infinite number of those distances can be summed to equal a
non-infinite number by use of the integral. That function, along with the derivative, is in the realm of, for
10 points, what branch of mathematics invented independently by Newton and Leibniz (LIBE-nitz)?
ANSWER: calculus
The Knaster-Kuratowski fan is constructed from points of one construct named for this man, which
was generalized by Smith and Volterra in a form that has a positive Lebesgue measure. With Heine,
this man names a result that states that every continuous function between a compact metric space
and a metric space is uniformly continuous. This man's theorem says that the power set of A has a
greater cardinality than A, and Paul Cohen worked on one conjecture of this man. This man's
namesake dust is a three-dimensional version of another construct in which the middle third of a line
segment is repeatedly removed. For 10 points, name this originator of the continuum hypothesis, whose
namesake diagnolization argument showed that the real numbers are uncountable.
ANSWER: Georg Cantor
This mathematician proposed a problem which became the first of Hilbert's problems and is known as the
continuum hypothesis. This mathematician developed the concept of numbers that are larger than all finite
numbers but not necessarily infinite, which he called transfinite numbers; and his eponymous fractal is
created by taking the closed interval zero, one and repeatedly deleting open middle thirds. This
mathematician attempted to write every number in its binary representation but derived a contradiction to
show that the set of reals is uncountable-his namesake diagonal argument. Name this German founder of
set theory.
ANSWER: Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor
The theorem named for this mathematician states that the cardinality of a power set is greater than the
cardinality of the original set. The function named after him, known as the Devil's staircase and commonly
used as an example of a function that is continuous but not absolutely continuous, is based on the base-3
representation of a number. That function is closely related to the set named for him, also known as his
"dust", which is generated by repeatedly removing open middle thirds starting with the closed unit interval.
He is credited with developing the continuum hypothesis and transfinite numbers. Name this mathematician
who used a diagonalization argument to show that there are more real numbers than integers.
ANSWER: Georg [GAY-awrk] (Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp) Cantor
This man proved the uniqueness of a function's representation as a trigonometric series, and he's the
second namesake of a theorem that states that any continuous function from a compact space to
another metric space is uniformly continuous. The first of Hilbert's twenty-three problems was
proposed by this man and states that there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the
integers and reals. This man's namesake theorem states that for any set A, the cardinality of its power set is
larger. This man used his namesake diagonal argument to show that there are an infinite number of sets for
which a bijection cannot be created with the set of natural numbers. For 10 points, name this mathematician
who came up with the Continuum Hypothesis and created Naive Set theory.
ANSWER: Georg Cantor
This mathematician demonstrated that selecting a number from every diagonal decimal place on a list of
the rational numbers and altering it by one digit produces a real number, proving that the rational numbers
are not on a one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers. He selected the symbol aleph-null to
represent the cardinality of the integers, and proved that infinite sets could be different sizes. For 10 points,
name this nineteenth century German mathematician who founded set theory.
ANSWER: Georg Cantor
This man proved that a function can be represented as a unique series of trigonometric functions. Along
with Bernstein, this man names a theorem stating that two sets are equinumerous if each is equinumerous to
a subset of the other. This man showed that there is a bijection between the points of the unit segment and
all the points of an n-dimensional space. His namesake theorem states that the cardinality of a set is less
than that of its power set. He introduced the idea that there are no sets with cardinalities between those of
the naturals and the reals, the continuum hypothesis. For 10 points, name this German-born mathematician
who used a diagonal argument to prove the uncountability of the reals.
ANSWER: Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Phillip Cantor
Russell's paradox was developed to discredit one of this mathematician's theorems. The function named for
this person has a derivative that is Lebesgue [lah-BEG] integrable, but that integral does not equal the
change of the function. That function, which is not absolutely continuous, can be called the Devil's
staircase, and it is based on repeatedly removing middle thirds to form this mathematician's namesake set.
Name this person who showed real numbers are not countable by diagonalization and who discovered
transfinite numbers.
ANSWER: Georg Cantor
In dynamical systems, the invariant tori named for Kolmogorov, Arnold, and Moser which not
destroyed by perturbation become this invariant construct. The paths in an infinite complete binary
tree correspond to an order-preserving bijection to this construct. Smith, Volterra, and its namesake
formulated a "fat" version of this construct which has positive measure, while the original has zero
measure. This construct is a totally disconnected space, and is a fractal with dimension log base three
of two. The (*) Sierpinski carpet and Menger sponge are the two- and three-dimensional generalizations of
this construct, while a finite Cartesian product generates its namesake multi-dimensional "dust." It is
constructed by deleting the open middle thirds of a set of line segments ad infinitum. For 10 points, what is
this set discovered by the man with a namesake "diagonal argument?"
ANSWER: Cantor set
If this property's value cannot be expressed in terms of smaller values for it, as in the case of irregular
Mose-Kelly sets or non-well-ordered sets, it is called "inaccessible." For the set containing only itself and
the empty set, it is one; its value for the power set of any set with value A is given by 2A. It is usually
notated by enclosing a set in flat brackets. Its first use was Cantor's "Diagonal Argument" for the
Continuum Hypothesis, which states that the value of this property must be a nonnegative integer. For 10
points identify this property, which for the integers has the value aleph-null and is used to designate the
relative sizes of infinite sets.
ANSWER: Cardinality
This curve is the envelope formed by starting with a fixed circle and drawing all circles whose centers are
on the fixed circle and which go through a fixed point on the fixed circle. If the value k is used to generate
one of these, then its circumference is 8k. One of these gives the largest border for the Mandelbrot set, and,
similar to a cycloid, one can be generated by following a point on a circle as that circle rolls around another
circle with the same radius. This is generated by the polar equation r equals k times the quantity one minus
cosine theta. Name this type of limacon [limuh-sawn] named for its resemblance to a heart.
ANSWER: cardioid [prompt on limacon]
This shape can be generated by taking a circle and a point on its circumference, then drawing all circles that
both pass through that point and are centered on the circumference of the original circle. A large version of
this shape appears at the center of a picture of the Mandelbrot Set, and this shape is generated by following
a point on the rim of one circle as it rotates around another circle of the same size. This limacon (LIM-uhsohn) with a cusp is generated by the equation r equals one plus the cosine of theta. Identify this shape
named for its resemblance to a heart.

Alford, Grandville, and Pomerance proved the conjecture there exists infinitely many of them. They
must be capable of dividing the denominator of their associated Bernoulli number. Erdos developed a
technique for constructing large ones and they must be (*) squarefree according to Korselt's criteria.
The Miller-Rabin probabilistic primality test fails for these numbers and they must possess at least three
prime factors. For 10 points-name these odd composite numbers, which are known as absolute
psuedoprimes and satisfy Fermat's little theorem for relatively prime values.
ANSWER: Carmichael numbers
The German mathematician Jungius made necessary the existence of this curve by disproving a common
assumption. A road that contains "bumps" in the shape of this curve will allow a square wheel to roll
smoothly. Though it's not a line, the ratio of the area underneath this curve to its length is constant over any
horizontal interval. Besides the plane, the surface of revolution of this curve is the only such surface with
zero mean curvature. Robert Hooke was the first to advocate the use of these curves in the construction of
arches because of their self-supporting nature. This curve can by drawn by the focus of a parabola rolling
along a straight line. For 10 points, name this curve given by the hyperbolic cosine function, the shape of a
hanging chain.
ANSWER: catenary [accept hyperbolic cosine before mentioned, I guess]
This is a roulette traced out by the focus of a parabola rolled along a straight line. The surface formed by
rotating this curve around the x-axis is a minimal surface, and can be formed by dipping two circles into a
bubble solution and drawing them apart slowly. Its equation is given by a hyperbolic cosine function and
when inverted, this curve is the ideal shape of an arch, as there is almost no shear stress between the
individual stones of the arch. The Gateway Arch is built in the shape of an inverted one of these with both
ends hung at the same height. For 10 points, name this curve formed when a piece of rope is hung freely
from two points, pulled down by nothing but its own weight.
ANSWER: catenary curve (prompt on "catenoid")
In 1697, David Gregory wrote a comprehensive treatise on this shape, and a challenge in Acta Eruditorum
to find its equation prompted solutions from Huygens (HOY-gunz), Leibniz, and Johann Bernoulli. Euler
(OY-lur) proved that this shape produces the surface of revolution with minimum area, while a road pitted
with a continuous series of these curves will allow a square wheel to roll smoothly. This curve is traced by
the focus of a parabola as it rolls along a straight line, and it is asymptotic to graphs of both exponential
growth and exponential decay. Because it eliminates shear forces at joints and causes weight to be directed
down into the ground rather than at an angle, Robert Hooke determined that this is the optimal shape of an
arch. Having general equation y equals a times the hyperbolic cosine of the quantity x over a, name this
curve that results when a cable or chain hangs under its own weight.
ANSWER: catenary [prompt on hyperbolic cosine function or cosh]
A probability distribution named after this man and sometimes Lorentz is shaped similarly to the normal
distribution, except its tails decline much less rapidly. The idea that if f of z is analytic on a simply

The general case of Fermat's conjecture that all positive integers are the sum of at most three triangular
numbers, four square numbers, and so on was proved by this man. He found the first general proof that the
Euler characteristic of vertices - edges + faces for a convex polyhedron is 2. The first to rigorously prove
Taylor's theorem, his namesake remainder applies to Taylor series, and a more general form of the NavierStokes equations is his momentum equation. He found that if a function is holomorphic along two different
paths between points, the path integrals will be the same in his namesake integral theorem. He also found a
special case of the Holder inequality, which parallels the triangle inequality but uses products rather than
sums. For 10 points, name this French mathematician who gives his name to that inequality along with
Hermann Schwarz.
ANSWER: Augustin-Louis Cauchy
This person's integral theorem, integral formula, and argument principle, all of which use closed paths,
helped form the basis of complex analysis. This mathematician designed a distribution usually named for
him, though Hendrik Lorentz's name is sometimes included, that has no mean. His name is also used for
sequences in which the difference between terms approaches zero. Peano [PEE-ahno], Lagrange [lahGRAHNJ], and this person developed formulas for the remainder of Taylor's theorem. Name this
Frenchman who attempted to prove the theorems of calculus, sometimes credited for developing deltaepsilon proofs and limits.
ANSWER: Augustin-Louis Cauchy
The distribution of ratios of numbers selected from a normal distribution is named after this
mathematician. If a prime p divides the order of a group, then according to a theorem due to him,
that group has an element of order p. A formula due to this mathematician gives the value of a
holomorphic function at each point inside a circle in terms of the values of the function on the
circle. If two paths have the same initial and terminal paths, then the integral over them for a
holomorphic function in that region is equal for the two paths according to an "integral theorem"
due to him. This man was the first to discover an inequality stating that two vectors's dot product
is less than the product of their magnitudes. For 10 points, identify this French mathematician
who names a notable inequality with Hermann Schwarz.
ANSWER: Augustin-Louis Cauchy
An equation that relates the product of the mass density and the velocity of a fluid to the divergence of the
stress tensor is called this man's "momentum equation." A theorem named for him states that the integral of
a holomorphic function over a closed loop is equal to zero, and he also co-names a pair of equations that
must be satisfied by the real and imaginary parts of a holomorphic function. In addition, he co-names a
relation which states that the inner product of two vectors is less than or equal to the product of their norms,
of which the triangle inequality is a special case. For 10 points, identify this mathematician who lends his

With Edouard Goursat, he names a theorem which states that the integral of a complex-valued function on a
closed contour in a simply-connected domain is zero. A generalization of his eponymous integral formula is
used to define the coefficients of the terms in a Laurent series. With Bernhard Riemann, he is the namesake
of two partial differential equations that are necessary and sufficient conditions to prove that a function is
analytic. He developed a theory of elasticity that related stress to strain by a 6 by 6 tensor known as the
stiffness matrix, effectively generalizing Hooke's law to three dimensions. FTP, name this French

ANSWER: Augustin-Louis Cauchy
For initial value problems, he names a boundary condition that is a weighted mean of the Dirichlet
and Neumann conditions, and he names the existence and uniqueness theorem for analytical PDEs
with Kowalevski. He lends his name to some equations that provide a necessary and sufficient
condition for a differentiable function to be (*) holomorphic in an open set with Riemann. On an inner
product space, the absolute value of the inner product of x and y is less than or equal to the norm of x times
the norm of y in a statement attributed to him and a German. For 10 points, identify this French

Sophie Kowalevski completed a theorem involving local existence and uniqueness of analytical partial
differential equations initially proven in a special case by this man, whose name, along with that of Binet, is
also appended to a formula generalizing the multiplicativity of the determinants of two matrices. If the

For an integral with bounds of negative and positive infinity, this mathematician names the quantity
that is the limit of the integral for bounds negative and positive A, where A goes to infinity, which is
his principal value. A theorem named for this mathematician states that, in a simply connected

This mathematician names a surface in spacetime which intersects every non-spacelike curve in that
spacetime exactly once, and a value named for him appears in the Kramers-Kronig relations. A weaker
form of Sylow's first theorem is his theorem which states that if a prime number p divides the order of G,
then G has a subgroup of order p. He names a theorem stating that the integral of a function on a simply
connected region is equal to the sum of the function's a sub negative one Laurent coefficients at each pole
in the region. Any complex differentiable function will satisfy the pair of differential equations named for
him and Riemann, and he is the first namesake of an inequality on vector spaces. For 10 points, name this
French mathematician whose namesake sequence converges in a complete space.
ANSWER: Augustin-Louis Cauchy
Along with Euler, this man names an equation equal to the sum of i equals one to n of a-i times x to the i
times the i-the derivative of y. Completeness of a metric space depends upon whether this man's namesake
sequences converge to an element of that space. In order to be complex differentiable, a function must
satisfy equations named for this man and Riemann. Bunyakovsky, a German and this man discovered that
the inner product of two vectors is less than or equal to the product of their norms, which is a general case
of the triangle inequality. For 10 points, name this mathematician who co-names that inequality with
Hermann Schwarz.
ANSWER: Augustin-Louis Cauchy
Terms with indices that are powers of two are used in this mathematician's namesake condensation test to
check for convergence of a series. With Hadamard, this mathematician names a formula that calculates the
radius of convergence of a power series. He's not Lagrange, but he names a theorem stating that if a prime p
divides the order of a group, then the group contains an element with order p. Partial differential equations
that give a necessary and sufficient condition for a complex function to be holomorphic are named for him
and Riemann. Sequences named for this man, by definition, converge inside complete metric spaces. For 10
points, name this French mathematician who names an inequality relating the dot product of two vectors and
their magnitudes along with Hermann Schwarz.
ANSWER: Augustin-Louis Cauchy
Its first published proof used the calculus of variations, and evidence has been accumulated to show that
Gauss was aware of the implications of it much earlier. A later mathematician showed that removed the
hypothesis that a function's derivative must be continuous for its applications. This theorem can be used to
prove another of its namesake's contributions to mathematics important to complex analysis. For ten
points, give this theorem that states that the integral of a holomorphic function about a closed loop is equal
to zero.
ANSWER: Cauchy's integral theorem [or Cauchy-Goursat theorem do not accept Cauchy's integral formula]
For a Lie algebra, this term defines the set of all elements a such that, for all elements in the algebra, the
commutation operation between a and any of those elements yields zero. On a graph, this point is
sometimes named for Jordan and is the set of all vertices with minimal eccentricity. Euler lines by definition
pass through this point of the nine-point circle. In group theory, this term applies to the members of a group
that commute with every other member and is often denoted Z, while the altitudes of a triangle meet at the
point called the ortho- this. For 10 points, give this name, which, in geometry defines a position whose
distance from the edge of a circle is the radius, since it is exactly in the middle.
ANSWER: center
The rate at which the operation implied by this statement occurs is given by the Berry-Esseen theorem. Paul
Levy proved a version of this statement using the technique of characteristic functions borrowed from
Poincare, while various local proofs of it were given by Richard von Mises. A version of this statement is
named after Lyapunov and requires the satisfaction of his namesake conditions, while a weaker condition
than Lyapunov's is due to Lindeberg. The Edgeworth expansion was developed as an improvement of this
statement, the proof of which is similar to the proof of the law of large numbers. For ten points, identify this
theorem which holds that the distribution of the average of a set of arbitrarily distributed variables
converges to the normal distribution.
ANSWER: central limit theorem
This can be proven using Levy's continuity theorem. It holds under Lindeberg's condition, which does not
require different variables to be identically distributed, and it also holds under the Lyapunov [LYAH-poonof] condition. The de Moivre-Laplace [de-MOV lah-PLAHS] theorem specifically addresses the case of a
binomial distribution with fixed probability. Name this theorem that predicts a normal distribution.
ANSWER: central limit theorem
The amount of error created by applying this theorem to intermediate values is the subject of the
Berry-Esseen theorem. The Cramer-Wold theorem can be used to generalize this in a multivariate manner.
The de Moivre-Laplace theorem is a special case of this. One statement of this is named for Feller and
Lindeberg and this is true when Lyapunov's condition holds. A rule of thumb resulting from this is that one
should have a minimum of 30 in a sample when the population is non-Gaussian. When sampling, this
theorem implies a distribution with standard deviation sigma over square root n. For 10 points, name this
theorem that implies as sample sizes get larger, the distribution of sample means approaches a normal
distribution.
ANSWER: central limit theorem
Pappus- theorem is sometimes named for this point because it uses the distance traveled by this point to find
a volume or surface area. The location of this point can be found by averaging the coordinates of the
vertices of the shape it is associated with. This point is always twice as far from the orthocenter as it is from
the circumcenter. For a shape of uniform density, this point is equivalent to the barycenter or the center of
mass. Name this intersection of the three medians of a triangle.
ANSWER: .centroid (prompt on "center of mass", "center of gravity", or "barycenter")
This point is collinear with the Nagel Point, incenter, and Spieker center. It is always twice as far from the
orthocenter as from the circumcenter, and it is collinear with those points together with the nine-point circle
center. Its barycentric coordinates never change, and it always is located in the interior of the triangle. This
point is a point of concurrency of three cevians (CHAY-vee-uns), and the ratio of each of the smaller
segments of those cevians to point of concurrency is 2 to 1. If a triangle is made of uniform density, this
point is located at the center of mass. Name this point of intersection of the medians of a triangle.
ANSWER: centroids [prompt on center of mass; prompt on center of gravity]
One form of this is used to find derivatives of functions that depend on dependent variables, and this is
generalized by Faa di Bruno's formula. This is also used to justify the standard method of implicit
differentiation, which involves multiplying terms by y prime when they are generated by taking a derivative
with respect to y. Like the power rule, this can be combined with the product rule to prove the quotient rule,
and it is used to find derivatives of composite functions. Name this rule which instructs mathematicians to
multiply by the derivative of the inside function when taking a derivative.
ANSWER: chain rule (accept implicit differentiation or implicit derivative before it is mentioned, prompt "derivative")
This phenomenon is not possible in planar, finite, continuous dynamics due to the Poincare-Bendixson
theorem. Given mixing and density properties, it corresponds to a Lyapunov exponent with positive real
part because it is typified by exponential divergence in time of initially close trajectories. The long-time
behavior of all trajectories in systems exhibiting this behavior is typified by fractals to which all points in
state space converge, termed strange attractors. Partially arising due to the butterfly effect, for 10 points,
name this type of behavior which is deterministic but difficult to predict, in contrast with stochastic
behavior.
ANSWER: deterministic chaos [prompt on butterfly effect or clear-knowledge equivalents before it's mentioned]
Systems are generally tested for this property by calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent and
seeing if it is positive. One model exhibits this property as its parameter passes 3.57; the ratio of its
period-doubling intervals approaches the (*) Feigenbaum constant. Systems exhibiting this phenomenon
include the nonlinear damping present in the van der Pol oscillator, as well as the double pendulum and the
logistic map. This theory was largely inspired by weather simulations performed by Edward Lorenz. For 10
points, name this theory that studies systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.
ANSWER: chaos theory
An example of a system that exhibits this behavior is created by mapping a square onto itself by
squishing it, stretching it, and folding it back on itself; that is the Smale Horseshoe. Systems of this
type have dense periodic orbits and undergo topological mixing. The Henon map and Lorenz map
exhibit this behavior, and it commonly arises when the maximal Lyapunov exponent is positive. A
simple physical example of a system exhibiting it is the (*) double pendulum. Systems with this behavior
often have strange attractors, and they are by definition deterministic and highly sensitive to initial
conditions. For 10 points, identify this phenomenon in which a dynamical system exhibits unpredictable
behaviors, which is exemplified by the butterfly effect.
ANSWER: chaos [or word forms like chaotic or chaotic behavior; accept chaos theory]
This phenomenon can be found in a system governed by a set of three differential equations that is
topologically defined as the Cartesian product of a ribbon with the Cantor set. This phenomenon is found in
the Rossler System, and it arises when a fixed point of a dynamical system loses stability, sometimes known
as the Hopf Bifurcation. These systems are characterized by period doubling and often occur when values
take on the Feigenbaum constants. Examples of this type of system include the Lorenz water wheel, as well
as pendulum attached to another pendulum. For 10 points, identify this phenomenon in which systems are
deterministic but appear to behave randomly over time, exemplified by the butterfly effect.
ANSWER: deterministic chaos
A well-known Axiom A diffeomorphism in this field of study is the Smale horseshoe. It studies systems
with a positive value for the Lyapunov exponent, and those exhibiting period-doubling bifurcations
characterized by the Feigenbaum constants. This theory features fractal entities called strange attractors,
such as one named after Edward Lorenz, who pioneered this field of math by concluding that the weather is
nearly impossible to predict accurately due to its sensitivity to initial conditions. For 10 points, name this
theory studying deterministic but seemingly random systems exhibiting the "butterfly effect."
ANSWER: chaos theory or nonlinear dynamical systems
One example of the escape type of these things is octal 033 and prefixes escape sequences; the
backslash is another example often used in programming languages. These things are the smallest possible
match for a regular expression. Their control examples include carriage return and line feed. Types of
encodings for them include UTF-8 and ASCII. An array of these things constitutes a string in C. For 10
points, name these things declared with the keyword char in C.
ANSWER: characters
For a ring, this value is the number of times you have to add the multiplicative identity to get the
additive identity. It's not "minimal," but this adjective describes an object that is the product of all invariant
factors of a Jordan normal form. This term also denotes a type of curve along which a partial differential
equation becomes an ordinary differential equation and is solvable. The Cayley-Hamilton theorem concerns
solutions to a polynomial described by this adjective, which has zeroes at the eigenvalues of an associated
matrix. This word also denotes a quantity computed by the formula vertices minus edges plus faces. For 10
points, give this mathematical term that denotes a quantity that is two for any convex polyhedron and is
named for Euler.
ANSWER: characteristic [or characteristic polynomial; or Euler characteristic; or characteristic curve]
This function can be defined as the product of elementary divisors of its associated map. The Jordan
canonical form exists if this function splits completely over the base field. This function annihilates its
associated map, by the (*) Cayley-Hamilton theorem. This function's zeroes lie on the unit circle for a
unitary map. If the geometric multiplicity is less than the algebraic multiplicity of one of this function's
zeroes, then the associated map is not diagonalizable. This function's constant term is the determinant. This
function can be computed by taking the determinant of its associated map minus Lambda*I. For 10 points, name this
polynomial whose roots are the eigenvalues of its associated linear map.
ANSWER: characteristic polynomial [or characteristic equation]
Restricting that the subject of this statement be unimodal yields a similar one named for Vysochanski
and Petunin, which introduces an additional 4/9 factor. This statement can be proven by defining Y
to be x minus mu quantity squared and a to be sigma-k quantity squared and then applying (*)
Markov's inequality. When this statement is applied to a sample mean, it can be used to prove the law of
large numbers. For 10 points, name this statement which, in one phrasing states that posits that all values in
a probability distribution are a limited distance from its mean.
ANSWER: Chebyshev's inequality [or equation or theorem]
A specific case of this theorem adds a factor of four-ninths and called the Vysochanski-Petunin
theorem. One result of this name states that n times the sum over all k of a sub k times b sub k is
equal to or greater than the product of the sum of a_k times the sum of b sub k A simple way to
prove this theorem involves applying Markov's inequality to the expected value of sigma-sub-k. This
theorem is used to prove the law of large numbers when applied to a sample mean, and it is usually stated in
terms of the value one minus one over k squared. For 10 points, name this theorem which gives the
maximum number of values that are a certain number of standard deviations away from the mean.
ANSWER: Chebyshev's inequality
This statement can be proven using Markov's inequality, and it can be used to prove the weak law of large
numbers and Kolmogorov's inequality. Markov's inequality states that the probability of a positive random
variable exceeding a given value is less than or equal to the expected value of the random variable divided
by the given value, and Kolmogorov's inequality limits the sum of random variables. One consequence of
this theorem is that the difference between the mean and median of a set of numbers is less than the standard
deviation. Name this statement that the probability that the distance from a number in a distribution to the
expected value is greater than k standard deviations is always less than or equal to one over k squared.
ANSWER: Chebyshev's inequality [or Chebyshev's theorem]
Its cumulative distribution function is the ratio of two gamma distributions, the upper of which is an
integral from zero to x over 2. An extra factor of one-half is multiplied before squaring in its
namesake statistic, a method named for Yates. The quotient of two of these lead to the F distribution
used in ANOVA, and the product of (*) row and column totals over the grand total for a contingency
table is used in a test using it invented by Pearson. Defined as the sum of the squares of k normal random
variables with unit variance, FTP, name this distribution whose statistic is used for a goodness-of-fit test, a
certain exponentiation of a Greek letter.
ANSWER: chi-square
Cryptographic applications of this theorem include the Mignotte and Asmuth-Bloom secret sharing
schemes. Godel derived his Beta function using this theorem. Along with Euler's Theorem, the
Pohlig-Hellman algorithm primarily uses this statement in order to compute discrete logarithms. It
can be used to prove that the (*) totient function preserves products. An isomorphism between a quotient
ring and a product of quotient rings can be shown to exist using an extension of this theorem. Supposedly
used by ancient generals to count the number of soldiers in an army, this theorem states that there exists a
solution to a set congruence relations if the moduli are all positive integers and are pairwise coprime. For 10
points, name this theorem which was supposedly first proposed in the third century C.E. by Sun Tzu.
ANSWER: Chinese Remainder Theorem [prompt on CRT]
This result can be applied to solve the Hermite interpolation problem by extending it to a P-I-D.
Mignotte and Asmuth-Bloom both name secret sharing schemes that rely on this result, and one
extension of this result is used to show that the direct product of a series of quotient rings is
isomorphic to R over the intersection of the ideals used to generate the quotient rings. All solutions
found via this result, which is often used alongside the Extended (*) Euclidean algorithm, are congruent
modulo the least common multiple of the pairwise coprime dividends. This theorem is often used to solve
systems of simultaneous congruences. For 10 points, name this theorem from number theory which can find
a number n given a series of remainders when n is divided by different integers.
ANSWER: Chinese Remainder Theorem
A mapping that is amusingly called the Ruritanian exists when re-indexed data generated from this
result is used in the Good-Thomas version of the Fast Fourier Transform. A corollary to this result
states that for a collection of positive integers, and an integer k, a ring isomorphism exists over the
ring of integers defined by k. This theorem forms the basis of quickly computing a public key in
multiword cryptography. (*) Diophantine equations that can be solved using Euclid's algorithm may be
equivalently solved by use of this result. One of the requirements for this theorem is that all of the moduli
be pairwise coprime. This theorem guarantees the existence of a solution to a system of linear congruences.
For 10 points, name this theorem first proved by Sun Tzu.
ANSWER: Chinese Remainder Theorem
A consequence of it is the Boolean Prime Ideal Theorem, and Skolem used it to correct Lowenheim's
Theorem on first-order models. It can be equated to one formulation of Konig's theorem, which relates the
cardinality of certain sums to products, and it is used to decompose a hollow unit sphere into two identical
spheres in the proof of the Banach-Tarski paradox. Equivalent to saying a partially ordered set in which
every chain is bounded has a maximal element, it is independent of Zermelo-Frankel set theory. For 10
points, identify this equivalent to the well-ordering principle and Zorn's Lemma, which states that one can
pick an element from each of an infinite collection of sets.
ANSWER: The Axiom of Choice [accept Zorn's Lemma or the well-ordering principle before each is read]
The Goodman-Myhill theorem shows that this result is enough to prove the law of the
excluded middle. The proof of the Cantor-Bernstein-Schroeder theorem notably does not rely on
this result. It is used to prove a theorem stating that no first-order theory can control the
cardinality of their infinite models, which is the Lowenstein-Skolem theorem. Equivalent to the
statement that every vector space has a basis, this result plus ZF was shown by Paul Cohen to be
independent of the continuum hypothesis. Often stated as the idea that the Cartesian product of a
collection of non-empty sets is non-empty, this statement is equivalent to the idea that every nonempty
set of positive integers has a least element, which is called the well-ordering principle. For
10 points, name this statement from mathematics, which allows any set to have some function to
pick elements of the set.
ANSWER: axiom of choice [or Zorn's lemma; or well-ordering principle until it is read]
Elliot Mendelson proved the independence of a weak form of this statement and a consequence of it is
Vitali's theorem. A proof using this statement involves showing that the intersection of all towers is a chain.
This statement is used in proving the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem by implying the existence of a function
that maps M to the n to M. Zermelo first used it to prove a theorem that for every set there is some relation
such that every subset of that set has a least element. The continuum hypothesis was shown to be
independent of ZFC plus this statement by Paul Cohen, and it is equivalent to Zorn's Lemma and the wellordering principle. For 10 points, name this set-theoretic axiom that informally states that we can come up
with a function that will pick things for us.
ANSWER: axiom of choice [accept Zorn's lemma or well ordering principle before mention]
Holditch's Theorem generates a second shape by sliding around one of these, and Bertrand's [bair-trawn-z]
problem is about the distribution of the lengths of one of these compared to a triangle's sides. When an
angle is bisected to create three of these, the sum of the lengths of the outside two equals twice the cosine of
the half angle times the length of the middle one in the lemma named for three of these. When one of these
splits another segment, part of the other segment is called a sagitta. One of these splits a sector into an
isosceles triangle and a circular segment. The length of one of them can be calculated using the Pythagorean
theorem given the lengths of an apothem [uh-PAH-thum] and a radius. Name these segments that connect
two points on a shape, particularly one that has two endpoints on a circle.
ANSWER: chords [prompt on segment]
If one of these segments is the angle bisector between two others, then the sum of the lengths of the original
two is equal to twice the middle one times the cosine of the angle between the middle segment and either of
the two originals. The Butterfly Theorem involves one of these segments that is bisected by two others. The
perpendicular distance from a shape to this segment is called a
sagitta, and this segment divides a sector into an isosceles triangle and a circular segment. One of these
segments is split in two pieces when using the power theorem inside a circle. Give the name for a
segment connecting two points on a circle.
ANSWER: chord
A Reuleaux triangle is formed when three of these intersect. This object is formed by the parametric
equations x equals a-cosine-t and y equals a-sine-t. This object is essentially a subtype of a certain conic
section with an eccentricity of zero and two foci in the same location. A line linking two points on this
shape is a chord, while a section of its only side is called an arc. For 10 points, name this shape, which has a
radius, circumference, and center.
ANSWER: circle [prompt on ellipse or oval]
The theorem for these shapes named after Descartes is used to generate the inner and outer Soddy ones. A
family of these shapes forms the solution to the differential equation y prime equals negative x over y, and
Apollonius demonstrated that this shape is formed by the locus of points k times as distant from one fixed
point as they are from another. The osculating type is used to find the curvature of paths at a point, and in
Ancient Greece many attempted the impossible problem of drawing a square with the same area as one. In
polar coordinates, this is the graph of r equals one, whose coordinates are cosine of theta comma sine of
theta and which is called the "unit" example of these figures. This is also generated by the equation x
squared plus y squared equals r squared. Name these two-dimensional shapes with a fixed radius.
ANSWER: circles
Carl Gauss studied how many lattice points are inside of these shapes. An annulus is the region
between two of these shapes. For any triangle, the foot of each altitude, the midpoint from each
vertex to the orthocenter, and the midpoint of each side always lie on one of these figures, which is
known as the "nine-point" example. The trigonometric functions are defined on the "unit" example
of this shape, which is generated by the equation x2 + y2 = 1 ["x squared plus y squared equals one"].
Segments connecting points on this shape are called chords. Name this shape with a constant radius.
ANSWER: circle(s)
The solution to the brachistochrone (BRAH-kih-stoh-crone) problem is a curve formed by rotation of
this shape. The area between two of these shapes forms an annulus (AH-nuh-luhs). A triangle's midpoints,
altitudes and orthocenter can be used to construct the "nine point" variant of this shape. Rotating this shape
around an axis forms a torus. This shape is a conic section with an eccentricity of zero. For 10 points, name
this shape that is the set of all points equidistant from the center.
ANSWER: circle
The two Villarceau ones are formed by cutting a torus diagonally through the center at an angle, and
Reuleaux polygons are formed from the intersections of these entities. This shape is the equality case
of the isoperimetric inequality, and points on the perimeter of these objects trace out cycloids. This
shape has constant (*) curvature and an eccentricity of zero, and can be described parametrically using
sines and cosines. Given a specified length of fencing, this shape encloses the maximum area. When they
are centered at the origin, they are described by the equation x squared plus y squared equals r squared. For
10 points, name this two-dimensional geometric shape with constant radius.
ANSWER: circles
A theorem of Koebe states that all finite simple planar graphs can be represented by tangencies of these
objects. An Apollonian gasket is a fractal made up of these objects. The midpoints of the sides of a triangle
and the feet of its altitudes all lie on one of these objects named for Feuerbach. A cycloid is traced by a
point on this shape as it moves along a line. For shapes with a (*) fixed perimeter, this shape maximizes
area. These shapes are described by the polar equation r equals cosine theta and by r equals a constant. For
ten points, name this shape consisting of all points at a given distance from its center.
ANSWER: circle
The type of this shape that is tangent to a curve at a point has the same curvature as that curve at that point
and lies on the inner side of that curve is referred to as an "osculating" one of these shapes. A curve that is
both a brachistochrone and a tautochrone is generated using this shape. A torus is be generated by revolving
this shape about an axis in three-dimensional space, a cycloid is generated by rolling this shape, and a
sphere is generated by rotating this shape. For 10 points, name this shape, the area of which is equal to pi
times its radius squared.
ANSWER: a circle
In the Steinhaus-Moser notation, the number two with a pentagon or this shape around it is equal to two
hundred fifty-six. Gershgorin's theorem uses this shape to estimate matrix eigenvalues, and the Cesaro
equation for this shape is kappa equals one over alpha. Four of these shapes, including two named for
Villarceau [vee-LAR-so], can be drawn through a torus. This shape has an eccentricity of zero, and
Ferdinand Lindemann proved that squaring this shape was impossible. For 10 points, name this shape
whose area is pi times the radius squared.
ANSWER: circles
Families of these geometric figures that are orthogonal to one another are named for Apollonius
of Perga. These figures can be defined as the locus of points whose distance from a pair of points
holds to a fixed ratio. Ptolemy's theorem relates the length of the sides of a quadrilateral inscribed in
one of these figures. One of these that passes through the midpoints and feet of the altitudes of a
triangle is known as the (*) nine-point one. The Law of Sines can be proven by showing that every
triangle can be circumscribed by one of these figures. These figures arise when cutting a cone with a plane
parallel to the base, and they have zero eccentricity. For 10 points, name this shape whose circumference is
pi times its diameter.
ANSWER: circles
Two similar triangles are drawn inside one of these shapes in the Butterfly Theorem. An angle whose rays
both intersect this shape twice is subject to the Secant-Secant Theorem, and the power of a point depends
on its location relative to the center of one of these shapes. This shape is generated in polar coordinates by
setting the value of r equal to a constant. Name this locus [LOE-kus] of all points in a plane a fixed distance
from a fixed point, a shape whose area can be found by multiplying pi times radius squared.
ANSWER: circle
Clifford's theorem is be used to show that an infinite set of these with common intersection points can be
constructed given four of these which intersect at one point. Villarceau showed that given an arbitrary point
on a torus, four of these can be drawn passing through that point. Apollonius defined these objects as the set
of points which have a constant ratio for distances to two fixed points, while Feuerbach's theorem describes
one which passes through nine important points on a triangle. Represented by the parametric equations x = a
cos t and y = a sin t in Cartesian space, for 10 points, identify these geometric structures whose
circumference is given by the formula 2 pi R.

Casey's Theorems deals with the tangents of five of these. Feuerbach's theorem involves the
nine-point one. A great one is a straight line in (*) gnomonic projection. This shape results from the
intersection of a cone and a plane perpendicular to the symmetry of the cone. A more common equation for
it is x squared plus y squared equals r squared, where r is the radius. For 10 points, name this shape
consisting of points that are equidistant from the center, whose circumference is given by 2 pi r.
ANSWER: circle
The osculating type of this figure for a curve at point P has the same tangent and kappa as that curve
at that point. The curve that is the solution to the brachistochrone problem is created using this
figure. This figure has parametric equations x equal to a times cosine of t and y equal to a sine of t.
Rotation of it around a central axis forms a torus. This figure is a (*) conic section with eccentricity
zero and is a specific case of an ellipse that has equal major and minor axes. For 10 points, name this figure
that consists of all the points on a plane equidistant from a center point.
ANSWER: circle
This curve can be considered the limit of an apeirogon in Euclidian geometry. A Reuleaux triangle is
formed by the mutual intersection of three of these objects, and Apollonius's problem concerns their
mutual tangency. In hyperbolic geometry, its length is equal to two pi times sinh ["cinch"] r. The
Cesaro equation for this curve is k equals one over a, meaning it is the only curve with constant finite
(*) curvature at all points. It is the conic section with zero eccentricity formed by a plane perpendicular to
the cone's axis of symmetry. Its equation can be given parametrically by x equals A cosine t and y equals A
sine t. For 10 points, name this figure which is the locus of all points the same distance from the center,
whose "unit" variety has radius 1.
ANSWER: circle
The Reuleaux triangle is formed from the intersection of three of these objects. It is given by the
parametric functions x equals a cosine t and y equals a sine t, and in polar coordinates it is given by the
equation r equals a. It can be formed by the intersection of a cone and a plane parallel to the base of the
cone. For 10 points, give this two-dimensional geometric object with area proportional to the square of its
radius.
ANSWER: circle
These objects are the fibers in the Hopf fibration of a four-dimensional sphere. The fundamental group
of these objects is isomorphic to the integers under addition. Descartes- theorem gives a quadratic
relation between the sizes of four of these objects. A torus is the Cartesian product of two of these
entities. Calculus of variations can prove that these shapes enclose the maximal area for a given
perimeter. An ellipse is one of these figures if its eccentricity is zero, which implies that these figures
have equal major and minor axes. For 10 points, identify these two-dimensional figures which are the set
of all points located exactly a certain distance from another one, whose area equals pi-r-squared.
ANSWER: circles
The movement of one of these shapes along a line generates the solution to the brachistochrone problem.
These shapes have an eccentricity of 0, and rotating one of these about an outside axis yields a torus.
Chords are line segments within, and secants are lines through, two points on this shape, whose "unit" type
is graphed by "x squared plus y squared equals 1". For 10 points, name this shape whose points are all
equidistant from the center, which have a radius and a circumference.
ANSWER: circles
This figure is homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of the real numbers. One of these figures
that intersects the midpoints of all the sides and the feet of all the altitudes of a triangle is called the "ninepoint" one. Because the roots of unity fall on this figure, it can be parametrized by the sine and cosine
functions. This figure maximizes the ratio of area to perimeter. In polar coordinates, it can be defined by the

The equation for this shape in polar coordinates is R of theta equals A. A cycloid is the curve created by
the path of a point on one of these shapes moving in a straight line. Venn diagrams portray intersections of
these shapes, whose area equals pi times R squared. For 10 points, name this shape created by finding all
points of an equal distance from the center.
ANSWER: circles
The symmetry group of this figure is O(2,R) ("oh two R"). It has constant finite curvature, and the powerof-a-point theorem relates the lengths of certain line segments constructed relative to a point and one of
these figures. The shortest path between two points on a sphere is along a "great" one of these. These conic
sections with eccentricity 0 can be graphed parametrically as "x equals r cosine theta" and "y equals r sine
theta," or in polar coordinates as "r equals a constant." The equation "x squared plus y squared equals 1"
describes the "unit" one of these. For 10 points, name this figure consisting of points equidistant from the

In quantum mechanics, certain pairs of linear operators that lack this property, such as position and

For 10 points, name this mathematical property which states that changing the order of operands does not
change the result of a binary operation, or that a times b equals b times a.
ANSWER: commutative property [or commutativity, commute, or other word forms]
An integral domain is a ring with no zero divisors that has this property. Division algebras where this holds

A technique named for Wallman is used to impart this property to T1 spaces, and that method is the
same as one named for Stone and Cech for normal spaces. The Arzela-Ascoli theorem gives
conditions for whether continuous functions from a metric space with this property preserve it and
the product of spaces with this property retains this property under (*) Tychonoff's theorem. A subset
of n-space retains it if any infinite subset has at least one accumulation point in the set, and it is equivalent

Lindstrom's theorem states that first-order logic is the strongest logic having both this property and

Three different types of this property are equivalent on a Banach space according to the Eberlein-
Smulian theorem. A method of imparting this property to a space by adjoining a single point to it is
called the Alexandroff extension. Specific varieties of this property include the "limit point" variety
and the "sequential" variety. A family of functions will not have this property without being (*)
equicontinuous. The extreme value theorem follows from the fact that this property is preserved by

One optional part of this process combines known operands into static forms; that process, known as
constant folding, is often combined with constant propagation to replace known variables. For
unchanging expressions with no side effects, this process can utilize loop invariant code motion and
strength reduction and it can also reduce branching through another technique. (*) Bootstrapping is a
term for writing certain types of programs that do this. Later stages of this process include register
allocation and instruction selection, and a common optimization for it is loop unrolling. Examples of
programs that do this process are clang, gcc, and javac. For 10 points, name this process that usually
converts high-level source code to low-level machine code.

This process may invoke the Sethi-Ullman algorithm. Code security and machine-specific optimizations are
made possible by the just-in-time form of this process. That aforementioned algorithm processes a syntax
tree using the fewest possible registers. Open-source examples of programs that do this include gcc, and
essential steps taken by those programs include lexical analysis and optimization. For 10 points, name this
act of transforming source code into another, usually lower-level, language en route to creating an
executable program.
ANSWER: compiling [accept word forms]
These engineered objects often utilize constant folding and register allocation to improve their output, and
these analyze their input for control and data dependencies. One of these is called self-hosting if it can
process itself as input. These programs can be classified as just-in-time, and its front-end tasks include
lexing and parsing. Examples of this type of software include PathScale and Clang, the latter of which uses
the LLVM infrastructure. Identify this type of software that typically converts code from a high-level
language's source code to a lower-level executable program.
ANSWER: compilers
In some circumstances, these programs perform modulo scheduling. These programs sometimes
perform operations like re-materialization and loop unrolling. Forward declarations help these
programs run in a single pass. The front end of these programs generates an intermediate
representation and execute after type checking takes place. Java relies on the (*) just-in-time variety
of these programs. These programs create bytecode and usually work in tandem with an interpreter or
virtual machine. In C, these programs often rely on a makefile. These entities fail to complete their task
when a program has syntax errors. For 10 points, identify these programs that transform source code into
machine-readable code.
ANSWER: compiler
The ability to re-target these systems is aided by the use of intermediate representation. A popular book
on these programs is affectionately known as the Dragon Book. Backtracking during one phase of these
programs can be mostly eliminated by eliminating left recursion and performing left factoring. The first
step of these programs creates atoms of information called tokens. The result of their "cross-" type can be
used on different architectures than the one used. These programs have five major phases: lexical analysis,
parsing, semantic analysis, optimization and code generation. For 10 points, identify these programs that
generate machine code from a source program and are contrasted with interpreters.
ANSWER: compilers
The Dragon Book is a classic tome describing the design of these programs. Yacc is a tool for converting
Backus-Naur specifications into a component of these programs. Constant folding and loop unrolling are
optimizations that these programs may perform. HipHop is one that is described as "source-to-source".
Their front-end features include tokenization and syntax- and type-checking. Writing one of these in its own
source language is called bootstrapping. javac ("java-see") is one of these that produces bytecode to run on
a virtual machine. For 10 points, name these computer programs that convert a source language into a
lower-level language to create executable code.
ANSWER: compilers [generously prompt on "translator" or "transformer"]
Tombstone diagrams were originally created to describe these programs, which are the subject of a classic
textbook by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman. Static type checking is often employed by these programs, and several
methods for optimizing these programs rely on use-define chains and include jump threading, strength
reduction, and loop optimization. A call graph is created during the execution of these programs, and a
common instance of Byzantine faulting occurs when syntatic information gets out of phase with one
component of these programs. The just-in-time variety operates during runtime, and these programs perform
lexical analysis and parsing, followed by code generation. For 10 points, name these programs that
transform source code from a high-level language into a lower-level language, used to create executables.
ANSWER: compiler
The first self-hosting type of these programs was written in Lisp and created through bootstrapping. One
type of these takes in bytecode at runtime; that type is used by Java and .NET (dot net) and is
"just-in-time." Because these programs are used before a program is executed, languages that use them
often run faster than those using an interpreter. For 10 points, name this programs which translate higher
order languages into assembly code.
ANSWER: compilers [or word forms]
SSA form may be used to simplify the optimization process in one of these objects, which may include
speedups such as constant-folding and loop-invariant reduction. In one of these, the input is first lexed and
parsed, after which code generation translates the original input into optimized assembly. On Unix systems,
examples of these programs for C and C++ are gcc and g++, respectively, and languages which use these
are often contrasted with 'interpreted- languages. For ten points, name these programs, which translate
source code into machine code.
ANSWER: compilers
The WAM is an type of the "stage" version of them, which operate on theoretical systems. Briggs,
Cooper, and Torczon made a type of optimization for them known as "rematerialization," while
other methods of optimizing them include peepholing, which reduces the total number of
instructions. Adding forward declarations makes "single-pass" ones less error-prone. Those that aren't
used until runtime are known as "Just-In-Time" ones, and ones written in the language they're used for are
called bootstrappers. Usually consisting of a lexical analyzer, a parser, and a code generator, for 10 points,
name these objects that convert source code into machine code.
ANSWER: compilers
Ones that operate on purely theoretical systems are the "stage" type, and in general they can be
created by devices that accept a Backus-Naur Form file as input. "Wide" ones iterate on their
intermediate output and are more complex than the (*) "single pass" type. One type can be improved
by doing a "pre-JIT" to reduce start-up delay, and a common stage in their operation uses a parse tree to for
syntactical analysis. Ones written in the same language they are being used on are called bootstrappers, and
on the fly ones are called Just In Time. Sometimes outputting to data that can be read by a virtual machine,
for 10 points, name these objects that convert source code into target machine code.
ANSWER: Compiler (prompt on "Just in Time Compiler" during the pre-JIT sentence)
Constant propagation, constant folding, and static analysis are all techniques used in the
intermediate stages of one of these tools. They typically operate on an intermediate representation
which consists of single static assignments grouped into basic blocks. These tools use live variable
analysis to control register pressure. Advanced ones are capable of instruction scheduling and interprocedural analysis. Their front end typically consists of a (*) scanner, which performs lexical analysis
to produce tokens, and a parser, which does semantic and syntactic analysis. Their back-end consists of an
architecture-specific code-generator. Fortran had the first operational one of these tools, which are not
needed by interpreted programming languages. Name, for ten points, this kind of program that turns source
code into binary code.
ANSWER: Compiler
The method of these things accomplishes subtraction using addition. This term refers to a set that contains
all of the elements not in a given set, or to the event that a given event does not happen. If two angles have
this relationship, then their tangents are reciprocals. The sine of an angle equals the cosine of the angle with
this relationship to the first angle. Name this term that also refers to angles that add to ninety degrees.

A novel proof of a theorem named for this property was the subject of Leon Henkin's doctoral dissertation.
In first-order logic, the converse of this property is soundness. That previous theorem named for this
property has been used to prove the compactness theorem, and states that every logically valid formula of
first-order logic has a finite deduction. A measure is said to have this property if every subset of a null set
has measure zero. Normed vector spaces with this property are Banach spaces. A metric space in which
every Cauchy sequence converges has this property. Graphs of this type have every vertex adjacent to every
other vertex. For 10 points, name this property of the real numbers which intuitively says that there are no
missing points.
ANSWER: completeness [or word forms]
For an object possessing this property on a metric space, evaluating the object at two different points
and forming a sum of pairwise products of each evaluation is equal to the delta function applicable in
the metric space; such an equation is usually known as the this relation for the object. In general, this
property is defined with respect to a norm such that the norm of any object minus a linear
combination of objects from a set with this property can be made arbitrarily small. That's because,
for sets with this property, these exist some weights such that the weighted sum of the set is a faithful
representation of any function almost (*) everywhere on corresponding space. FTP, name this property
that is possessed by even non-orthogonal, non-normal bases, which can be achieved by adding the limit
points to a metric space, so that the space no longer has any holes.

If for a number n, the Legendre symbol a over n does not equal the Jacobi symbol a over n, then n must
have this property. The ring Z mod nZ of integer congruence classes modulo n has zero divisors if and only
if n has this distinction. With one exception, if n has this property then zero is congruent to n minus one
factorial mod n by Wilson's theorem. All Fermat numbers with index between five and 32 have this
property. Euler's Theorem works with these numbers and not just their complementary set as in Fermat's
Little Theorem. These are the numbers that are crossed out in the Sieve of Eratosthenes. All even numbers
have this property. For 10 points, name these integers that are greater than one and not prime.
ANSWER: composite
If n is "highly" this, then there is another number between n and 2n that is also "highly" this type of number.
Phi of n is bounded by n minus the square root of n if n is one of these numbers and phi is the totient
function. If n is one of these, then n minus one factorial is not congruent to negative one, mod n, by
Wilson's theorem. If there is a number n between 1 and x such that n to the x is not congruent to n mod x,
then x is one of these numbers. Since Carmichael numbers are this type of number, the converse of Fermat's
Little Theorem does not hold. For 10 points, name this type of number that has positive divisors other than
one and itself and is thus not prime.
ANSWER: highly composite numbers
The nth derivative of functions using this operation can be found using Faa di Bruno's formula, and the
reverse of this process sometimes involves writing a given matrix as the product of an orthogonal matrix
times an upper triangular matrix. For linear functions without shifts, this operation is equivalent to
multiplication. To find the first derivative of functions expressed with this operation, the Chain Rule is used,
and this operation can be used to express a function which performs one operation after another as a
combination of simpler functions. Often represented with an open circle, name this operation of inputting
one function into another.

A dynamic example of these algorithms developed by Ziv and Lempel optimizes based on the sample
being examined. These algorithms can be performed if the Shannon entropy is less than the average
encoding length. The discrete cosine transform and run-length encoding are "lossy" examples of these
algorithms. Those are often performed with images or sound, where missing information may go unnoticed.
A lossless example for images is the GIF format, and JPEG employs both lossy and lossless types of this.

One method for doing this is co-named for the inventor of the pentomino. That method is
Rice-Golomb and is based on RLE algorithms. One algorithm for this that is gaining support is
LZMA. One of the earliest techniques is named for Huffman. For some media like pictures, (*) lossy

identify this procedure in computer science where input data is encoded to make it smaller, which is done
when storing files in a zip archive.
ANSWER: data compression [or source coding; or bit-rate reduction; or word forms]
The basis of many of algorithms that perform this process are the 1977 and 1978 Lempel and Ziv
papers. One method used in this process is to express data as a finite sum of cosines, which is the
discrete cosine transform. Entropy encoding algorithms, such as arithmetic coding and Huffman
coding, can be used to losslessly perform this process. One of the most popular types of this process
uses the DEFLATE algorithm, which is used in the (*) PNG format and by zip files. For 10 points,
identify this method of reducing the size of files.
ANSWER: data compression [or image compression; or audio compression; source coding; or bit-rate reduction]
The LZW method for this procedure improved upon one which creates prefix codes based on the
frequency of symbols being used. Huffman coding is one method of this process, while a more facile
approach represents "runs" of (*) data with a single character and number. When this procedure retains
all the original data, it is called lossless. For 10 points, name this process which shrinks the number of bits
required to encode information.

The mapping type of this shape is sometimes called a homotopy (hoh-MAH-toh-pee) co-fiber and is similar
to a quotient space. This is the shape of a degenerate hyperboloid, and it can be represented in spherical
coordinates by setting the azimuth equal to a constant. The rectangular formula for this shape is z squared
equals x squared plus y squared, and slices of this shape were famously studied by Apollonius (ap-uh-LOHnee-us) of Perga (PUR-guh). As with pyramids, this shape has a volume equal to one-third base times
height. Identify this shape that has a circular base and a vertex.
ANSWER: right circular cone [or nappe]
One way to parameterize this solid is to set x equal to z times the cosine of theta, and set y equal
to z times the sine of theta. This solid is generated in spherical coordinates by setting the polar
angle equal to a constant, and this solid is generated in cylindrical coordinates by the equation z = r.
Rotations of slices of this solid form quadric surfaces such as ellipsoids and paraboloids; examples
of such slices include hyperbolas and parabolas, which are called its "sections". The volume of this
shape is calculated by multiplying one-third pi times height times radius squared. Name this shape
with an apex at the top and a circle at the bottom.

A correction to find the size of these constructs using an extra term of z2
2n
is named for Edwin Bidwell
Wilson. This concept was introduced by a mathematician who helped develop null hypothesis testing,
Jerzy Neyman [YEH-zhee NYE-mun]. The size of one of these constructs depends on the inverse error
function. One way to find their size is the percentile bootstrap method, and these constructs are
labeled with a percentage equivalent to one minus alpha, the significance level. Some graphs shows
these constructs using error bars, which are vertical segments, of an appropriate length. It is common
to size these quantities to correspond to 95% certainty. Name these "intervals" that, with a certain
probability, contain a measurement.
ANSWER: (percentile) confidence intervals [or score intervals; prompt on confidence levels]
The control of this occurrence is based on an optimization model developed by Frank Kelly. The
RED algorithm is used to deal with this and one way to indicate the occurrence of this is with ECN
bits. Nagle's algorithm attempts to prevent this from causing collapse due to overhead. In most
stacks, upon a timeout, the window for this is set to one MSS. To deal with this in most TCP
implementations, a slow start phase is used followed by a phase for the avoidance of this. The most
common way that this is discovered is when packets are (*) dropped by routers because their packet
queues are exceeded. When this occurs, users may notice increase in lag and a drop in effective bandwidth.
For 10 points, name this occurrence in a network where there is a lot of traffic leading to decreased
performance which also can occur on a highway during rush hour.

When one of these constructs is traced out pictorially, there will exist one or two Dandelin Spheres tangent
to the plane that traced it out. Studied in antiquity by Apollonius of Perga, in the two question problem, if the
center of mass is assumed to be at rest, the paths of the bodies will follow one of these paths. In polar
coordinates, they take the form of l over the quantity one plus e times cosine of theta, where l is the semilatus rectum and e is the eccentricity. For 10 points, name these mathematical curves that include the
ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola.
ANSWER: Conic Sections
Pairs of variables with this property are related by Pontryagin duality; that is, they are each other's
Fourier transforms. Those pairs of variables with this property are generally a variable and the
derivative of the action with respect to that variable; therefore, they have a lower limit on their (*)
commutators. In group theory, elements a and b in a group have this relationship if there is an element g
such that g times a times the inverse of g equals b. If a polynomial with real coefficients has roots that are
not real, the roots in question are two of these. For 10 points, give the word that also refers to the
relationship between a + bi and a - bi.
ANSWER: conjugates [accept word forms]
This operation often is combined with transposition for matrices, and matrices which do not change under
the combined operations are called Hermitian (hur-MI-shun). Performing this operation on a number,
multiplying the result by the number itself, and then taking the square root finds the complex modulus of the
number, which is also that number's absolute value or norm. When complex numbers are represented as
vectors, this operation reflects over the real axis. Simplifying fractions with complex numbers is often
accomplished by multiplying by the denominator after this operation has been done. Name this operation
which transforms a plus b i to a minus b i.
ANSWER: conjugate [accept word forms, e.g. conjugation]
An iterative method for numerically solving linear equations is known as the gradient method named for this
word. In algebra, this adjective describes two elements x and y such that xg equals gy for some element g,
while in physics, it describes variables to which the Heisenberg uncertainty principle applies. The adjoint of
a matrix is computed by transposing and performing an operation with this as its second word. That
operation is denoted by a bar over a number and leaves real numbers unchanged. For 10 points, name this
term which, describes the relation of the complex numbers a+bi and a-bi.
ANSWER: conjugate [or conjugation]
The L2 ["L two"] inner product requires this operation to be applied to the second function. For Fourier
series in terms of complex exponentials, this operation relates the nth Fourier coefficient to the negative nth
one. A Hermitian matrix is equal to the result of this operation applied to its transpose. For numbers in polar
form, this operation negates the argument. The square magnitude of a number results from multiplying it by
itself under this operation. If a polynomial with real coefficients has a complex root, then that root under
this operation is also a root. This operation, denoted by an asterisk or an over-bar, turns 3 plus i into 3
minus i. Identify this operation that negates the imaginary part of a complex number.
ANSWER: complex conjugate [or complex conjugation]
The dot product of x and y multiplies component-wise x and this of y. When in polar form it is produced by
negating the exponent. For any real number taking it is the same as the identity function. The addition of a
number to this for that number produces a real number which is equal to double the real component of the
previous number. It is distributive over multiplication and addition and it is represented with a bar above
the number, FTP, name this type of number formed by taking the negative of the imaginary part of a
complex number.

One of these numbers equal to the geometric mean of the coefficients of the continued fraction expansion of
x is named for Alexander Khinchin. The Loschmidt one of these is used in the definition of a unit of number
density named after Emile Amagat. The Hartree energy is one used in computational chemistry and physics,
and one of these created by Einstein was considered his "great blunder;" that was his cosmological one.

Two of these entities, represented by the Greek letters delta and alpha, are used to find ratios of
bifurcation intervals in chaos theory and are named for Feigenbaum. Another one of these entities is
found by taking the integral of the difference between the reciprocal of the floor function of x and the
reciprocal of x. That entity, used to evaluate the derivative of the gamma function, is represented by
a gamma and named for Euler and Mascheroni [mas-kair-OH-nee]. The example named for Boltzmann
is represented by a lower case k. This term is used to relate the square root of 2 to Pythagoras, and

In the context of robot motion planning, the Pfaffian ones of these are linearly independent values
that uniquely model rolling without slipping. The Rosen method of gradient projection is a method of
solving for these using a steepest descent method. Parallel parking is one example of a system
characterized by the differential types of these values, which are dependent upon the path taken,
ones that don-t are said to be holonomic. While using the (*) simplex method, inequalities that represent
these are used to define the feasible region. These statements define the boundaries of the candidate

name these values that must be satisfied to solve an optimization problem.
ANSWER: constraints
This process is the subject of the Poncelet-Steiner and Mohr-Mascheroni theorems, and it can be applied to
a polygon with n sides if and only if n can be expressed as the product of a power of two
and a Fermat prime. Because it cannot generate numbers whose minimal polynomial is greater than two, it
cannot be used to double a cube, and for other reasons it also cannot be used to trisect an angle or square a
circle. This process uses two unmarked tools, one of which allows the production of segments, and the other
of which allows the production of arcs and circles. Name this process which traditionally involves a
compass and straightedge.

A theorem on this property that connects pointwise convergence of characteristic functions and convergence
in distribution is named for Levy. The Radon-Nikodym derivative exists when one measure is "absolutely"
this with respect to another measureThe sequential form is strictly weaker in non-first-countable spaces than
the topological form of this property, which requires that the preimage of open sets be open. The Lipschitz
form of this property bounds the rate of change, and for a function, this property exists when the left and
right limits at every point are equal to the value at that point. FTP, name this property that describes
functions without "jumps."
ANSWER: continuity (accept equivalent forms)
For a non-compact subset of the reals, one can show that a function exists which has this property and is
bounded, but has no maximum. For a monotonic function on some real open interval, this property does not
hold on a set of points that is at most countable. The Weierstrass function is nowhere differentiable despite
having this property at every point, and a mapping between metric spaces has this property if and only if the
inverse mapping takes open sets to open sets. If for epsilon, there exists a delta such that the distance
between the image of two points of a function is less than epsilon when the distance between the points is
less than delta, the "uniform" version of this property holds. For 10 points, name this property of a function
which can be drawn without lifting pencil from paper.
ANSWER: continuity [or continuous; accept other word forms if there are any]
Any function from a set with the discrete topology will have this property, as the discrete topology
includes all elements and thus all subsets are open. A function has this property if the preimage of all
open sets in the range are also open. Any function with this property on a closed interval will also
meet the criterion for the stronger (*) "uniform" type of it. On a closed interval, a function of this type
will assume all intermediate values. Real functions have this property if for all x in the domain, the limit of
the function as it approaches x equals the function's value at that point. For 10 points, name this property of
functions that can be drawn without lifting the pencil.
ANSWER: continuity
A function with this property that maps a compact convex set onto itself has a fixed point according
to the Brouwer fixed point theorem. A mapping of this type from space X to space Y has this
property if for any open subset V of Y, the inverse image of V is an open subset of X. A bijective
mapping between topological spaces is a homeomorphism if the mapping and the inverse mapping
are open and have this property. If for any epsilon there exists a delta such that the distance between
f(x) and f(y) is less than epsilon when the distance between x and y is less than delta, the function is
(*) "uniformly" this. A function has this property if for any point c on an interval [a, b], the limit as x
approaches c of f(x) equals f(c). For 10 points, all differentiable functions must have what property in which
a function can be drawn without lifting pen from paper?
ANSWER: continuity [or word forms like "continuous"]
A homotopy equivalence between two functions from spaces X to Y is the existence of an invertible
mapping of this type between the two functions. The Lipschitz form of this quantity is not possessed
by the square root and exponential functions because the slope becomes arbitrarily steep. One
definition of this property is that each (*) epsilon has a delta such that if x minus c is within delta, then f
of x minus f of c is within epsilon. This property may also be defined as the statement that the limit of f as x
goes to c is equal to f of c. For 10 points, name this property of a function which means that there are no
discrete jumps or breaks in the line.
ANSWER: continuous (accept word forms like continuity)
Functions with a special type of this property make up Holder spaces. The fundamental theorem of
Lebesgue integral calculus relates the existence of a derivative-like function with one type of this
property. Preimages of open sets on functions with this property are open. This property is not
fulfilled by the (*) Cantor function. The uniform type of this property is held by any function with this
property on a compact set. A function has this property at a point if its limit at that point is equal to its value

function's input can create arbitrarily small changes in its output.
ANSWER: Continuity [accept word forms; accept Lipschitz continuity, sequential continuity, absolute continuity, or uniform continuity]
On a closed interval, functions with this property will also possess the uniform type of it. This is a
necessary condition for use of the intermediate and extreme value theorems. The first fundamental theorem
of calculus says all functions of this type will have antiderivatives. It is a necessary condition for being
differentiable, and does not occur at singularities and jumps. For 10 points, name this property, possessed
by functions that can be drawn without lifting the pencil.
ANSWER: continuity [or continuous]
A function f has this property at x for some x in the domain if for any neighborhood U of f(x), there is a
neighborhood V of x such that f(V) = U. The Weierstrass function is differentiable nowhere but has this
property everywhere. Cauchy gives this condition for a function f at a point c as the assurance that, for all
epsilon greater than zero, there exists delta such that x being closer to c than delta implies that f(x) is closer
to f(c) than epsilon. For 10 points, name this property that suggests a small change in a function's input
results in a small change in its value, rather than a break or a jump or a hole.
ANSWER: continuous [accept word forms]
One type of this property used in measure theory is denoted by a double-less-than sign, and means that
whenever the mu of a set is zero, the nu of that set must also be zero. If a function with this property has
compact domain, then it has the uniform variety of this property as well. Probability distributions with this
property have a zero chance of producing any specific result. Despite having this property everywhere, the
Weierstrass function is differentiable nowhere. A function f has this property if the limit of f-of-x as x
approaches the point c is f-of-c. For 10 points, name this mathematical property possessed by functions
whose graphs have no holes or breaks.
ANSWER: continuity [accept word forms, accept absolute or uniform continuity]
These functions are the morphisms in the category Top. A surjective function of this kind that evenly
covers a neighborhood of every image point is called a covering map. There exists a sequence of
polynomials converging uniformly to any of these functions by the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. By an
epsilon-over-3 argument, if a sequence of them converges uniformly, then the limit is one of these
functions as well. These functions preserve (*) compactness and connectedness. These functions are
defined as ones for which the preimage of open sets are open and the function must be one on a closed
interval in the extreme, mean, and intermediate value theorems. For 10 points, name these functions where f
of cequals the limit of f of x as x approaches c.
ANSWER: continuous function
A strong version of this property is required for the method of Picard iteration and the Banach fixed
point theorem. Homeomorphisms are bijections with this property whose inverses also have this
property. Maps with this property preserve connectedness and compactness. One definition states
that a map has this property if the pre-image of an open set is an open set; whereas the
aforementioned strong definition of this property states that a function has it if the distance between
the images of two points over the distance between the two points themselves is less than a constant.
That second definition of this concept is named for (*) Lipschitz. The Weierstrauss function is nowhere
differential but has this property everywhere. For 10 points, name this property that for real-valued
functions means that value of the function at a point must be arbitrarily close to that at neighboring points, a
term which also describes a function whose graph can be drawn without picking up a pencil?
ANSWER: continuity [accept continuous]
The Heine-Cantor theorem states that if there is compactness, this property is equivalent to its uniform
variety. The Dirichlet function does not have this property anywhere. In Lesbegue integration, its absolute
version holds for a function f on an interval if and only if there exists a function g such that the integral of g
from the start of the interval to any point in the interval equals f. Its topological definition requires that the
inverse of every open set be open. A function f of x has this property at a point b if the limit of f of x as x
approaches b is f of b. For 10 points, name this property of some functions, sometimes described as the
ability to be drawn without raising a pencil.
ANSWER: continuous [accept word forms]
Freiling's axiom of symmetry is equivalent to the negation of this statement, and an axiom that would imply
that negation has been proposed by Woodin. Martin's axiom is a weaker form of it, suggesting that a
countable chain condition compact Hausdorff space cannot be the union of nowhere dense sets, while its
generalized form invokes the aleph numbers. Godel showed that it could only be affirmed, but it was found
by Paul Cohen to be independent of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. For 10 points, name this assertion that
there exists no set with cardinality between that of the integers and that of the reals.
ANSWER: continuum hypothesis
Euclid's proof that there are an infinite number of primes is an example of this type of proof, which uses the
law of bivalence. That proof involves the construction of the product of all primes plus 1, which Euclid
shows to be a prime number as well. Name this method of indirect proof, which begins by assuming the
opposite of the statement to be proved to deduce a logical impossibility.
ANSWER: proof by contradiction (or reductio ad absurdum or reductio ad impossibile or apagogical argument; accept indirect proof before mentioned)
In addition to being considered an indirect proof method, modus tollens is also known as a proof by this
type of statement. The relationship between this type of statement and an original statement is the same as
the relationship between an inverse and a converse, and that relationship can be used to solve logic
problems such as the ones in Lewis Carroll's book Symbolic Logic. If the original statement is that p implies
q, then this statement is that not q implies not p. Name this statement that has the same truth value as the
statement it is derived from.

For finite difference methods applied to PDEs, this property is equivalent to stability according to
the Lax equivalence theorem. The Weierstrass M-test can be used to test for this property. A
sequence of real numbers has this property if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence. For a series with
both positive and negative terms, the (*) "absolute" form of this property is stronger than the usual form,
only requiring that the terms go to zero. This property is possessed everywhere by the Taylor series for the
exponential function, while other power series may have some finite "radius of" this property. Common
tests to determine this property include the ratio test and the root test. For 10 points, give this mathematical
term for approaching a limit.
ANSWER: convergence [or other word forms of "converge"]
Every entire function can be written as a power series with this property on the complex plane. A
complete metric space is one where Cauchy sequences have this property. The Weierstrass M-test
can show whether something has the uniform type of this property. Geometric series will (*) always
have this property if the common ratio has absolute value between zero and one, and the harmonic series
does not possess it. For 10 points, name this opposite of divergence.
ANSWER: convergence [or has a limit]
In the real numbers, all Cauchy sequences possess this property. The harmonic series does not possess it,
though the alternating harmonic does. Generally, any alternating series satisfying Leibniz criterion will
possess it. The root test and ratio test can be used to see whether a given series possesses this property. For
10 points, name this property of sequences whose limits are finite, the opposite of divergence.
ANSWER: convergence [or word forms]
Compactness for a topological space implies that every ultrafilter has this property. The Wisjman
variety of this applies to closed subsets of metric spaces, the Gromov-Hausdorff metric helps define it
for sequences of compact metric spaces, a property which is named for those men. In a complete
metric space, a sequence being Cauchy (*) implies this property, and a test for it in series involves the
ratio of a-sub-n over a-sub-n minus one being less than one. For 10 points, name this property which is
possessed by a sequence that has a limit, indicating that its elements are approaching some finite value.
ANSWER: convergence [accept equivalents like "it converges" or "it has a limit"]
To determine if a Fourier series has this property, the Dini-Lipschitz criterion is used. The BolzanoWeierstrass theorem states that every bounded sequence in Rn has a subsequence that has this property. A
Cauchy sequence has this property if its metric space is complete. A geometric series has this property if the
absolute value of the common ratio is less than one. The harmonic series does not have this property. For 10
points, name this property of a sequence or series that approaches a finite limit, contrasted with divergence.
ANSWER: convergence [accept word forms]
The uniform and pointwise types of this property may be contrasted for sequences, and Cauchy sequences
in a complete space always have this property. A limit approaching zero is necessary but not sufficient for
this property, which exists when the root test gives a value less than one or the integral test gives a finite
number. The harmonic series lacks this property, but the alternating version thereof as well as p-series for p
greater than one do have this property. This term also applies to geometric series with ratio between
negative one and one. Give this term that describes series whose sum approaches a finite number, contrasted
with divergence.
ANSWER: convergence [accept word forms]
Egorov's theorem relates two types of this property for measurable functions. A theorem named for
Vitali applies when a dominating function cannot be found; when one can, Lebesgue's dominated this
theorem applies. This property also makes Fatou's lemma reduce to that theorem. The pointwise type
of this property is weaker than the uniform type. On the complex plane, this condition's equivalent is named
for Cauchy, since there, it's possible for each element past some point to be arbitrarily close, without
approaching a unique value. For 10 points, name this property lacked by the partial sums of the harmonic
series, which requires that a sequence has a limit.
ANSWER: convergence
A nested radical of some power p has this property if and only if the ith term in the radical raised to the p to
the i power is bounded according to a theorem named for Herschfeld. Any sequence of real numbers which
is Cauchy has this property and all sequences with this property are Cauchy. A bounded monotone
sequence must have this property, and every bounded sequence must have a subsequence of this type
according to the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. A power series has the absolute type of this property if the

have a limit.
ANSWER: convergence [accept word forms]
A Cauchy sequence in a complete metric space is automatically of this type. The root test is one method
designed to test for this property. This property does not hold for arithmetic sequences or the harmonic

approach a certain number, the opposite of divergent.
ANSWER: convergent [or word forms]
For closed sets of this type in the plane, also known as ovals, Helly's Theorem shows that, if any three have
non-empty intersection, they all have non-empty intersection. The supporting hyperplane theorem shows
that any set of this type can be realized as the intersection of closed hyperplanes. Karamata's inequality and
Jensen's inequality apply to functions of this type, and any local minimum of such a function must also be a
global minimum. FTP, name this mathematical property that for sets means that any line connecting two
points in such a set is also contained in the set, a word that often describes a sphere.

For a set of points, the Gram scan finds the minimal set of this type containing them. When g(x) is one
of these functions, g of the integral from 0 to 1 of f(x) is less than or equal to the integral of g of f according
to Jensen's inequality. A function is this on I, if for all x,y in I and all a between zero and one, f of quantity

property that is the opposite of concave.
ANSWER: convex [prompt on concave up before concave]
A linear combination of vectors is said to be this type of combination if the coefficients add to one and are
all nonnegative. If a function with a continuous second derivative has this property, then it is concave up. If
a polygon with n vertices has this property, then its number of interior diagonals equals one-half times n
times the quantity n minus three. If a set of points has this property, then it contains the entirety of all
segments connecting two of its points. Name this property belonging to polygons whose interior angles are
all less than 180 degrees.
ANSWER: convex
A function has this property on an interval if its second derivative is positive on that interval. A
polygon with this property contains all line segments between any pair of its points. A polygon of this

ANSWER: convex (accept convexity; accept concave upward)
Every cell generated by a Voronoi diagram is a polytope of this type. If the input to the Art
Gallery Problem has this property, then the solution only requires a single guard that may simply
adjust his field of view. For a Euclidean space, a set has this property if the line segment between
every pair of points stays within the set. A function has this property if its value at the midpoint of

The Frenet-Serret formulae relate torsion and this quantity to a set of three vectors. One type of this quantity
is given as the determinant of the shape operator and is the product of the two "principal" values of this.
The "intrinsic" type of it is undetectable to observers who are not on the manifold, and is exemplified by the
Gaussian type of this quantity, while the Ricci and Reimann tensors also describe this property. The
"extrinsic" type is defined as the derivative of the tangent angle with respect to the arclength at a point.
This quantity is the inverse of the radius of the osculating circle associated with a curve. For 10 points,
identify this quantity which roughly describes how much a plane or a line is bent.

The "sparsest" form of this graph property gives its name to an NP-Hard problem whose only known
efficient solution is an approximation algorithm that runs in "big O of the square root of N" time and
was developed by Arora, Rao, and Vazirani. Finding the "maximum" form of this property is also
NP-Hard, but Goemans and Williamson developed an approximation making use of semidefinite
programming. For planar graphs, finding that maximum value of it is the dual of the (*) routeinspection problem. The first algorithm to find the smallest number of edges affected by this property
repeatedly uses augmenting graphs to calculate residues; that algorithm was developed by Ford and
Fulkerson. In general, this term refers to a partition of a graph's vertices into two distinct subsets. For 10

In number theory, this term is used to designate integers with n minus one digits which, when multiplied by

generalized coordinate whose conjugate generalized momentum is conserved, and thus one on which the
Lagrangian does not depend. In group theory, this adjective is used to describe groups which are generated
by a single element, while in graph theory this term designates a graph which contains at least one path

The intersection of this shape with a sphere is known as Viviani's Curve, and the name of this shape is
given as an alternative name for Bessel functions. Mathematicians define this as the locus of points given by
adding a fixed curve plus a parameter times a fixed point, sometimes bounding it with two parallel planes.

In one sense, this figure is equal to the product of S1 and a subset of the real line. A Steinmetz solid is
produced from the intersection of these objects. The volume of a solid of revolution can be computed by
decomposing it into a number of shells of these objects and integrating. A system of coordinates named for
this figure is useful for solving problems that have an axial symmetry, and is constructed by adding a z-axis
to polar coordinates. The intersection of a plane with this figure will create an ellipse, since it is formed by
translating a circle along a perpendicular axis. For 10 points, name this three-dimensional shape whose

One of its successors, ICE, was published by Michael Kwan in 1997, and is a Feistel network with 16
rounds. Another of its successors, which uses the Rijndael method rather than Feistel networks, was adopted
by the US government in 2001. In April 2006, the parallel machine COPACOBANA at the University of
Bochum and Kiel in Germany broke it in 9 days. It had been under a great deal of scrutiny for supposed
government interference in design, involving both a shortening of the key length and a modified design of
the S-boxes. For 10 points, name this successor to the Lucifer cipher, a block cipher that was accepted by

The dependent form of these entities can depend on values and are implemented in the language Coq.
For a function, this entity is contravariant in its value for the input. Proving one of these is inhabited
is equivalent to proving a tautology, since they correspond to theorems in intuitionistic logic by the
(*) Curry-Howard correspondence. Allowing a function to have different behaviors based on the value of
this entity for its argument is called polymorphism. Depending on whether they are checked at compile-time
or runtime, a language can be classified as static or dynamic. These entities can be explicitly changed
through coercion or their namesake casting. For 10 points, name these classifications of programming
constructs such as int and string.
ANSWER: data types
Python employs the "duck" way of determining these constructs. C++ can use RTTI to determine these at
runtime as a form of introspection, and C++ uses templates in a similar fashion to "generic" ones.
Programming languages can be classified by having static, dynamic, strong, or weak systems of these. If
built into a language they can be called "primitive," while object-oriented programming allows the
programmer to implement new ones. For 10 points, name these programming constructs which include
characters, bools, integers, floats, and strings.
ANSWER: data types
Through the use of applications, abstractions and lets, Algorithm W infers these entities through
unification in the Hindley-Milner system. In the Curry-Howard isomorphism, mathematical
formulae are isomorphic to these constructs. These entities are not specified in the construction of
algorithms in generic programming paradigms because templates are made instead, which allows
these constructs to be determined at a later time. In C-like languages, a void pointer is not limited by
this entity's value, thus void pointers cannot be dereferenced; that's because a (*) reference is one of
these constructs in programming language theory. Correct usage of these entities are verified at compiletime in "static" languages; otherwise they are checked at run-time in "dynamic" languages. For 10 points,
name these constructs, such as "int," "bool," or "string," that specifies the kind of data of variables in

business intelligence known as a warehouse. HBase supports large types of these entities and
interfaces with Hadoop. These entities are typically backed by an audit trail, and they can be
traversed with cursors. Data types in these entities can be NVARCHARs. Durability, isolation, (*)
consistency, and atomicity make up the four ACID rules that govern transactions in these entities. Linking
different parts of these entities together is often done by joining on foreign keys. These entities are usually
organized into tables and columns. For 10 points, name these constructs from computer science that hold

Performance and scalability of these things can be improved using denormalizations like materialized

durability are the ACID properties that must be guaranteed for (*) transactions in these things. An
inner join of two elements of these things is equivalent to a cross join followed by a select. JOIN, SELECT,

Generalizing this operation to three dimensions requires the use of an operation symbolized with a

This man used a token ring to develop the first self-stabilizing algorithm in one paper, and one
method developed by this man is used in the OSPF routing protocol of IP networks. Another method
developed by this man can be used to create abstract syntax trees, but is more commonly used to
translate infix notation to RPN. In addition to the Shunting Yard Algorithm, he wrote the first
compiler for the Algol 60 language, and another construct developed by him uses the atomic operation V

ANSWER: Edsgar Dijkstra
In an algorithm developed by this person, reading a comma causes all operators up to but not
including a left parenthesis to be popped off the stack; that algorithm outputs operands in the order
in which they are encountered and pops operators off in order of precedence to rewrite infix
expressions to postfix expressions, which are also called Reverse Polish Notation. A Fibonacci heap is
used to implement a minimum priority queue in the (*) fastest version of an algorithm developed by this
man; that algorithm gives labels of "visited" or "unvisited" to nodes which have their distances calculated.
That algorithm only works with non-negative edge weights, so it can be replaced by the Bellman-Ford
algorithm and was the foundation for the A* algorithm. For 10 points, name this computer scientist who
developed an eponymous shortest path algorithm.

Link-state routing protocols, such as Open Shortest Path First, use this algorithm to generate forwarding

One of these properties for a commutative ring is given by the supremum of the length of chains of

the logarithms of the space-scaling rate and the log of the linear scaling rate; that form of this quantity is
named for Felix Hausdorff, and gives non-integer values for fractals. This value is equal to the number of
coordinates required to locate a point in a given space, which is why spherical and cylindrical coordinate
systems require three values, while polar coordinates require two. Give this value which equals zero for a
point and one for a line.

Vandiver's criterion for irregular pairs showed that this conjecture doesn-t hold for irregular primes. That
proof developed from Kummer's proof for this conjecture. Ken Ribet's proof that the Frey curve was not
modular gave a solution to the epsilon conjecture, which allowed another man to prove this conjecture by
proving that every elliptic curve is a modular form. That proof to this statement was given by Andrew
Wiles, and it was originally stated in the margins of a notebook. For 10 points, identify this problem which
suggested that there doesn-t exist any combation of numbers x, y, and z such that for n greater than 2, x to
the n plus y to the n equals z to the n.

irregular pair which satisfies Vandiver's criteria also satisfies this statement. Galois representations were
used to show that every elliptical curve has a modular form proving a special case of the Taniyama-Shimura
conjecture, which implies this statement regarding the solvability of a Diophantine equation involving the
addition of a to the n and b to the n to yield c to the n. Richard Taylor and Andrew Wiles gave the proof of,

Ernst Kummer proved this theorem for regular prime numbers, while Gerhard Frey discovered that it might
be proven using the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, which relates to the modularity of elliptic curves. It was
proven in 1994 by Andrew Wiles. For 10 points, name this theorem which states that there are no integer
solutions to a to the n plus b to the n equals c to the n if n is an integer greater than two, proposed but not
proven by its 17th-century French namesake.
ANSWER: Fermat's Last Theorem
This statement holds for exponent p in an irregular pair if the pair satisfies Vandiver's Criteria. Jean-Pierre
Serre asserted the non-modularity of the Frey curve to show that proving the semistable Taniyama-Shimura
Conjecture also implies this statement. This theorem only needed to be proven for odd prime powers after
its namesake proved it for the special case of n = 4, and it was finally proven by Andrew Wiles. For 10
points, name this theorem named for a French mathematician which states that, if n is greater than 2, there
are no integer solutions to the equation "a to the n plus b to the n equals c to the n".
ANSWER: Fermat's last theorem [prompt on just "Fermat's theorem"]
Ken Ribet proved the Epsilon conjecture by proving that it could be translated into a non-modular
elliptical curve, and therefore any counterexample would also serve as such for the Taniyama-Shimura
(taa-nee-YAA-maa she-MOO-rah) Conjecture. This theorem was eventually proven by Andrew Wiles. For
10 points, name this theorem that states that it is impossible to separate any power higher than the second

This problem's solution was aided by Ken Ribet's proving of the epsilon conjecture, which allowed
mathematicians to restrict their attention to semi-stable elliptic curves. This problem was then
attacked by associating triplets to elliptic curves, and noting that a counterexample would produce a
curve contradicting the (*) Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. It was finally solved in the mid-90s by Andrew
Wiles. For 10 points, name this problem stating that n equals 2 is the largest integer so that there are
non-zero solutions to a to the n plus b to the n equals c to the n.
ANSWER: Fermat's Last Theorem [prompt on Fermat's theorem; or Fermat; accept TaniyamaShimura conjecture until mentioned]
The solution to this problem was originally approached using horizontal Iwasawa theory, and a
weaker version of this result is derived from Falting's theorem. The proof of this theorem relied on
Ribet's work on the epsilon conjecture. It was proven for all primes less than 100 using Sophie
Germain's theorem. Its proof relied on a result that states that any elliptic curve over the rationals
can be obtained from a rational map, known as the (*) Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. The originator of
this result claimed to have a miraculous proof of it that the margin couldn't contain. For 10 points, name
this result proven by Andrew Wiles, which states that for n greater than 2, there are no integers x, y, and z
such that x to the n plus y to the n equals z to the n.
ANSWER: Fermat's Last theorem [prompt on "Fermat"]
The Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality implies the truth of this statement, as does a statement relating the
minimal discriminant to a conductor of a certain type of curve called Szpiro's conjecture. One statement that
leads to the proof of this statement is part of the Langlands program. The proof by Ken Ribet of the "epsilon
conjecture," which stated that the Frey curve was not modular, led to a proof of a special case of the
Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, whose truth implies the truth of this theorem. For ten points, identify this
theorem which states that the equation "x to the n plus y to the n equals z to the n" has no nonzero integer
solutions for integer n greater than two, eventually proved by Andrew Wile.
ANSWER: Fermat's Last Theorem
Kolyvagin and Flach's results on Euler systems replaced horizontal Iwasawa theory in the analysis of this
problem. Previously, Jean-Paul Serre had identified the "epsilon conjecture" as fundamental to the solution
of this problem, which is implied by the full modularity theorem. The Taniyama-Shimura conjecture was
equivalent to it, as was the modularity of certain elliptic curves. The original statement of this problem
concerned the solvability of a Diophantine equation and asked whether two nth powers could sum to
another nth power for all integers n. FTP, name this long-standing problem named after a French
mathematician, which was completed by Andrew Wiles.
ANSWER: solving Fermat's Last Theorem
A generalization of this theorem to polynomials is the basis for the Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena algorithm,
and this theorem can be used to prove that the periodicity of the decimal representation of a primedenominator fraction is some multiple of p-1. A combinatorial proof of it considers a bracelet with a
string of symbols, while its more easily proven via group theory using Lagrange's theorem. The RSA
encryption scheme is based on it, and generalizations of it include the defintion of the Carmichael function
and one that uses the totient function. For 10 points, name this theorem that states a to the p is congruent to
a mod p, for p prime.
ANSWER: Fermat's little theorem
The converse of this theorem is the basis of the Pratt certificate. Paul Zeitz' proof of this theorem relies on
considering a bracelet consisting of beads with a fixed number of characters, then removing those with only
one unique character. Another proof of it relies on using Lagrage's theorem on a multiplicative group G.
Also the basis of the RSA encryption scheme, the Carmichael numbers notably foil the test named for this
theorem, which can be generalized using Euler's totient function. Stating that a to the p is congruent to a
modulo p, for ten points, identify this theorem of number theory named after a French mathematician, which
is less famous than its namesake's last one.
ANSWER: Fermat's Little Theorem
A modified version of this theorem's converse is known as Lehmer's theorem, and a Pratt certificate uses a
so-called "witness" in conjunction with Lehmer's theorem. The strict converse of this theorem is disproven
by the first set of Knodel numbers, and Euler's totient theorem is a generalization of it. Wilson's theorem is
a corollary of it, and it follows almost directly from Lagrange's theorem. Carmichael numbers are
counterexamples to this theorem's strict converse, meaning that they are pseudoprime for all integer bases
with which they are coprime. For 10 points, identify this theorem that states that if p is prime, then for any
integer a, a to the quantity p minus one is equivalent to 1, modulo p.
ANSWER: Fermat's little theorem
One way to prove it is to use the invertibility of the natural number group up to its order ensured by
Bezout's identity, and apply Lagrange's theorem. Another proof of it uses induction on the binomial
theorem, and one of its corollaries can be stated in terms of a 2k factorial term in relation to minus one.
One of its consequences is Hannam's lemma, and a generalization of it using the totient function is known as
Euler's theorem. Its converse is Lehmer's theorem, and when a positive integer satisfies it for all choice of
bases, that integer is called a Carmichael number. Directly implying Wilson's theorem, FTP name this
theorem originally stated without proof, which states that a to the p mod p equals a mod p, for prime p, the
result of a French mathematician also known for his "last" theorem.

This is the number of solutions to the three-question problem when one of the bodies is assumed to be much
smaller than the others. This is number under the radical when finding the ratio between successively higher
Fibonacci numbers. The Abel-Ruffini theorem states that polynomials of this degree cannot be solved, and
this number is the second Fermat Prime and the third Sophie Germain Prime. This number is the When
arranging this many unique objects in a circle, there are 24 possible ways to do so, while arranging this
many objects in a straight line there are 120 ways. FTP, identify this number, which is also the cube root of
125 and the square root of 25.
ANSWER: five (5)
This is the first "untouchable number," and it is the number of "exceptional" Lie groups. The
complete graph with this many vertices is not planar according to Kuratowski's theorem. The AbelRuffini theorem states that this is the smallest degree of radicals in a polynomial with no general
solution. This is the second Fermat prime, the number of Platonic solids, and the fifth number of the
Fibonacci sequence. For 10 points, name this number, which is written one-zero-one in binary, and
equal to the square root of 25.
ANSWER: five
The diagonal lemma used to prove Godel's incompleteness theorems guarantees the existence of a selfreferential sentence which is one of these objects. The weak Kleene recursion theorem also guarantees the
existence of an index which is one of these, and the Y combinator is a function which returns one of these
objects. According to a result named for Knaster and Tarski in lattice theory, the set of these objects form a
complete lattice. Permutations for which these do not exist are called derangements. They always exist for
contraction mappings and continuous functions from a disk to itself according to theorems named for
Banach and Brouwer respectively. For 10 points, name these points such that f of x equals x which are
mapped to themselves by a given function.
ANSWER: Fixed Point
According to the Knaster-Tarski theorem, for an automorphism on a complete lattice L, the set of these will
also form a complete lattice. Isometries in Euclidean space must be the identity or a reflection if they have
more than one of these, and these objects are hyperbolic when the stability matrix has at least one positive
and one negative eigenvalue. One theorem about them depends on the function in question having a
Lipschitz constant of strictly less than one, and its proof shows that the x value is a Cauchy sequence and
converges as fast as that constant to the n, making the function a contraction mapping. Another theorem
states that any continuous mapping from the closed disk or ball to itself has one of these objects. Cosine has
one of these at about 0.73. For 10 points, name this type of point that maps to itself for given functions,
which are the subject of theorems named for Brouwer and Banach.
ANSWER: fixed points [accept equilibrium point; prompt on "critical points"]
The power-delay-product of one of these devices can be decreased using Aezinia and Lucas- genetic
algorithm. Pulse transition detectors are often used to implement edge triggering in these devices,
which overcome a caching problem that their master-slave counterparts often have. Shift registers
contain a series of these elements chained to the same clock. A simple one of these is created by
connecting two NAND gates together. These circuit elements, which come in JK, SR, D, and T varieties,
enter a period of metastability before settling into one of two states. For 10 points, identify this basic circuit
element which is used to store a single stable bit.
ANSWER: Flip-flop
An algorithm for designing finite state machines based on these elements involves taking the logical AND
of the memory input logic value with the corresponding branch condition and entering the result into a
Karnaugh map. In one type of this device, the switching logic is controlled by the truth table of its two data
inputs. Another type of this device lacks any data inputs at all. Another implementation of another type of
this device solves the "transparency" problem by connecting two latches in a master-slave configuration.
Used for implementing shift registers, the output of these devices is controlled by the rising or falling edge
timing signal. Coming in T, D, and JK varieties, for 10 points, identify these basic control elements in
digital logic which change between discrete states based on their clock input.
ANSWER: flip-flop [prompt on "logic gates" until the mention of "logic"]
Rounding errors mean that testing for safe division with these numbers requires care to avoid an overload.
The standard formats must comprise two kinds of "Not a number" values, two infinites, and finite numbers
for these numbers, whose currently accepted standard is IEEE 754. A common measure of computer
performance is the number of operations using these numbers that can be performed in a second, a measure
known as FLOPS. For 10 points, name these numbers that are represented using significant digits and an
exponent.
ANSWER: floating point numbers [accept floating point operations or floats; do not accept "FLOPS"]
One representation of this data type stores them as a mantissa, or significand, and exponent. That
representation is defined by the IEEE 754 standard. One measure of computing performance is the
number of operations that can be performed with this data type per second. The Pentium (*) FDIV
bug occurred in the unit that performed calculations with this data type. For 10 points, identify this data
type used to represent real numbers of computers, which is distinct from the integer data type.
ANSWER: floating point
The most common representation of these numbers always normalizes the first bit to one, negating the
need to store it and providing an extra bit of precision. That representation allows these numbers to be
represented with a sign, exponent and mantissa, comes in single, double and quad-precision formats and is
the IEEE 754 standard. Missing entries in the lookup table of the Pentium 5 FPU caused division of these
numbers to produce incorrect results. For 10 points, identify this representation of real numbers on
computers, whose data type is commonly "float."
ANSWER: floating-point numbers [or floats before "float" is read]
The machine epsilon is the smallest number this representation can have. In the most common standard
for them addition is not associative and there is a negative zero. In that standard it is also possible for a
value to be infinite or Not a Number. That standard is IEEE (Eye triple-E) 754. The 64-bit versions of these
are often called doubles. For 10 points, name this computer representation of numbers with decimal points.
ANSWER: floating point number [or float; or double before mentioned; or IEEE 754 before mentioned]
This number is the smallest composite Motzkin number, and a theorem based on this number was
proven in 1976 by Wolfgang Haken and Kenneth Appel. This is the smallest number of elements in a
non-cyclic group, and a tesseract, or hypercube, has this many (*) dimensions. It is the maximum
number of colors needed to color a plane, and is the smallest positive non-Fibonacci number. For ten points,
what number, the number of faces of a tetrahedron, is equal to two squared?
ANSWER: Four
The smallest noncyclic group has this many elements and is named for Felix Klein. Fermat proved his Last
Theorem in the case with the exponent equal to this value. Lagrange proved that all nonnegative integers are
a sum of this many squares. This is the maximum number of intersection points for two conic sections. This
is the period of the function i raised to the k power, since this number is the smallest positive power of i
equal to 1. The x- and y-axes split the plane into, for ten points, this many regions, called quadrants.
ANSWER: four
Frobenius's Theorem states that a real division algebra has a maximum of this many dimensions, and
William Hamilton first described such a division algebra with this many total dimensions, which
contains imaginary numbers represented as i, j, and k. The Heawood conjecture was proven for
segmented planes to show that this many colors are sufficient to shade a map so that no same-colored
regions bound each other. For 10 points, name this smallest composite number, which is the square of
the only even prime.
ANSWER: four
This is the only dimension for which there exist differential manifolds which are homeomorphic but
not diffeomorphic to Euclidean space. This is the smallest number such that there are two
nonisomoprhic groups of this order, since the Klein group has this order but is not cyclic. A theorem
of Lagrange states that any natural number can be written as a sum of this many (*) squares of
integers. This number is the order of the largest complete planar graph, and Appel and Haken proved that
this number is the maximum chromatic number for a planar graph. The Abel-Ruffini theorem states that this
is the highest order of a polynomial equation that can be solved by radicals. For 10 points, a famous
theorem states that any map coloring needs only how many colors?
ANSWER: four
Lagrange proved that any integer can be represented as the sum of at most this many squares, and
this is the largest integer such that polynomials of this degree have general solutions. Any map can be
colored with at most this many different colors, according to the "[BLANK] (*) color theorem." The
discriminant of a standard quadratic is equal to b squared minus this number multiplied by a times c. The
simplest Platonic solid, the tetrahedron, has this many faces. For 10 points, name this smallest composite
number.
ANSWER: four
This number is the minimum number of perfect squares that are needed to sum to any positive
integer. Both Abel and Ruffini proved that this number is the maximum degree polynomial for which
there is a general algebraic solution. This number is the chromatic number of the sphere and is also
the maximum number of colors needed to color a plane map such that no two regions sharing an edge
have the same color. For 10 points, name this minimum number of faces of a regular polyhedron, the
number of sides in a quadrilateral.
ANSWER: four
Casey's Theorem applies to this number of circles who are all tangent to another circle. Only primes
that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by this number can be expressed as the sum of two perfect
squares, and all natural numbers can be expressed as the sum of at most this many perfect squares.
In a cyclic polygon with this many sides, opposite angles sum to (*) one hundred eighty degrees. A twoelement set has this many subsets, and this is the fewest number of faces possessed by a Platonic solid. For
ten points, name this smallest composite number, the number of sides in a quadrilateral.
ANSWER: four
This number is the period, in pi units, of e to the quantity i x over two. Any number can be expressed
as the sum of this many integer squares. This number is the highest degree polynomial generally
solvable by an algebraic equation. The only Platonic solid with an equal number of vertices and faces
has this many of each. If the last two digits of a number are (*) divisible by this number, then that
number is divisible by this number. It is the smallest non-prime number and the only one whose prime
factors are equal both when multiplied and when added. For 10 points, identify this number of vertices of a
tetrahedron and the number of sides of a square.
ANSWER: four
This is the smallest number of which it can be said that every natural number can be written as
the sum of this many perfect squares, which is based on a theorem named for Lagrange. This
is also the largest number such that all polynomials with this degree can always be solved using
radicals. Wolfgang Haken and Kenneth Appel proved that any planar map with contiguous regions
and bordering regions with different colors can be drawn with this number of colors. This is also the
number of faces of a tetrahedron. Name this number equal to the number of sides of a trapezoid,
parallelogram, or square.
ANSWER: four
The smallest non-cyclic group has this numerical order. There are nine different ways of drawing non-
intersecting chords between this number of points on a circle's circumference. Every positive integer can be
expressed as the sum of this number of square numbers. Polynomials of this numerical degree can be solved
by Ferrari's method, and are the largest with general solutions. One theorem states any planar map can be
colored using at most this number of colors so that no two adjacent regions are the same color. The simplest
Platonic solid has this number of faces. For 10 points, name this smallest composite number and number of
sides on a rhombus.
ANSWER: four
One person managed to prove the Snark theorem while working on this problem, and one generalization is
stated in terms of edge contractions and is named for Hadwiger. Robertson, Sanders, and Seymour
improved on the original proof of this problem, while Ringel and Youngs proved a generalized version
which relies on the floor function of an expression involving the genus of the surface. Its proof used the
method of discharging and defined unavoidable sets and reducible configurations, and it is sometimes called
Guthrie's problem. It is a specific case of the Heawood conjecture and was proved by Appel and Hankin
using a computer. FTP, name this theorem that gives the number of shades needed to draw a map.
ANSWER: Four color theorem
A generalization of this result involves edge contractions and is named after Hugo Hadwiger. Kittel, Errera,
and Soifer showed that Kempe chains can be tangled, disproving one erroneous proof of this. Its
generalization, called the Heawood conjecture, contains the floor function and could not be proven
necessary and sufficient for cases of genus 0, necessitating a separate proof of this. A crossed-prism graph
can show that it does not hold for a torus. Its proof, demonstrated by Appel and Hakan, involved 1,936
configurations, each reduced to a smaller graph, then checked with a computer. For 10 points, name this
theorem stating the chromatic number needed to draw a map.
ANSWER: four-color (map) theorem or Guthrie's problem
One false proof of this statement was published in 1879 by Alfred Bray Kempe, and an early
correspondence about it consists of a letter sent from De Morgan to Hamilton. Francis and Frederick
Guthrie originated this problem. Heinrich Heesch's work on this problem led him to originate the
method of discharging. The eventual proof of this statement was simplified by Robertson and
Seymour, and was derisively compared to a (*) telephone directory by one critic. That proof was done by
Appel and Hankin using 1200 hours of computer time to check every case. For 10 points, name this
statement which gives the minimum number of shades needed to color a map.
ANSWER: four color theorem
It is a special case of a conjecture that one half times the smallest integer less than the quantity seven plus
the square root of 48 times the genus of an orientable space plus 1, close quantity, is equal to a certain
number associated with the space. Originally known as Gurthrie's conjecture, a fallacious counter example
was published as an April Fools day joke. This theorem showed that except in the case of the Klein bottle,
the Heawood conjecture holds. Originally solved by reducing the problem to 1,936 cases that were checked
by computer, for 10 points, identify this theorem, which states that any map in a plane can be filled in with a
certain number of colors.
ANSWER: The Four-Color map Theorem
Generalizations of this problem include the Hadwiger Conjecture, and Apollonian networks have a
unique solution to this problem. The 15-node Poussin graph exhibited a flaw in a supposed proof of
this statement by "tangling" Kempe chains, but Heawood used Kempe's work to prove a 25%
weaker bound on this problem. The proof of this conjecture required verifying (*) 1,936 separate
cases. It was finally proven in 1976 by Wolfgang Haken and Kenneth Appel with the aid of a computer. For
ten points, identify this mathematical problem, which states that any map with contiguous regions can be
colored with less than five colors.
ANSWER: Four Color Theorem
Vizing's theorem proves the swapping property of Kempe Chains holds, constructs often used in
solving this problem. Gonthier recently verified an earlier solution of this problem that ran in
quadratic time by Robertson et al, while Birkhoff and Franklin were able to prove that it held when
the number of (*) nodes was less than 25, a problem originally put forth by Guthrie. It was first solved by
Appel and Haken who used a computer to prove all 1,936 cases in this special case of the Heawood
Conjecture. For 10 points, name this theorem stating that any two regions sharing a common boundary on a
2D map can have dissimilar markings with less than a certain number of colors.
ANSWER: The Four-Color (Map) Theorem [or Guthrie Conjecture before read]
One unproven generalization of this theorem is equivalent to the statement that chi of G is equal to or
greater than the Hadwiger number of G. It is equivalent to the statement that no snark is planar. Another
generalization of this theorem was proven by Ringel and Youngs and depends on the floor of an expression
involving the square root of 1 plus 48g. It was proven by finding an unavoidable set of reducible
configurations, using the method of discharging; a later proof improved on the quartic time algorithm used.
It is a special case of the Heawood conjecture. For 10 points, name this theorem proved by Appel and
Hankin via computer, which gives the minimum number of shades necessary to produce a map.
ANSWER: four-color theorem [or Guthrie's problem]
The most recent proof of this theorem was provided by Georges Gonthier using the Coq assistant, while P.
G. Tait showed that it is equivalent to the statement that no snark is planar. The crucial concepts of
reducibility and unavoidability were introduced in Kempe's incorrect proof of this theorem, which can be
extended to polyhedra by the Heawood conjecture. This theorem does not apply when exclaves are present,
and neighbors that share only a single point do not meet this theorem's definition of adjacency. Proven by
Appel and Haken using a computer to test 1,936 distinct cases, name this theorem which gives an upper
bound on the maximum number of colors required to label a contiguous map.
ANSWER: four-color theorem
This idea was thought to be first suggested by Francis Guthrie, giving it an alternative name, though Arthur
Cayley may have been the first to address it. An attempt to prove this theorem was the Kempe algorithm,
and the Heawood conjecture degenerates into it when the genus of the space is zero. It was eventually
proven by Haken and Appel in 1976 using computer-generated configurations. For 10 points, identify this
theorem stating that a map may be filled with a certain sufficient number of colors such that adjacent
regions are different colors.
ANSWER: four color map theorem
Roberson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas proved this statement by showing that every snark has the
Petersen graph as a minor. This was first proposed by Francis Guthrie in 1852, and Kempe and Tait's
purported proofs for this were later shown to be incorrect after being unchallenged for eleven years. Appel
and Haken's proof of this theorem involved 1936 configurations. This was the first major theorem to be
proved using a computer. Name this theorem which states that no more than the eponymous number of
colors is needed to color a map so no adjacent regions are the same color.
ANSWER: Four-Color Map Theorem
This statement is the special case of a conjecture involving the floor function of the expression seven
plus the square root of one plus forty-eight times the genus, all over two. That conjecture was proven
by Ringel and Youngs. An unsolved generalization of this statement is known as the (*) Hadwiger
conjecture. An early false proof of it by Kempe was shown to be incorrect by Heawood. Its 1976 proof by
Appel and Haken created controversy because it was done with computer assistance. For 10 points, name
this theorem about the number of colors needed to color a map.
ANSWER: four color theorem
This theorem could be proved in a new way if Grunbaum's conjecture was proven. Attempts to prove this
theorem led to the development of Kempe chains and to snarks, the latter of which is a type of graph.
Heinrich Heesch's work on reducibility and discharging was used in the proof by Wolfgang Haken [HAHken] and Kenneth Appel, which used a computer to consider 1,936 cases. Name this theorem which,
assuming that regions are contiguous, provides a limit to the number of hues needed to fill in a map.
ANSWER: four-color map theorem
A dimensionless quantity named for him is the product of the thermal diffusivity and the timescale
divided by the square of the characteristic dimension, and he is also the namesake of a relation that
gives the heat flux as negatively proportional to the local temperature gradient. One operation
developed by this man exhibits an error called the Gibbs phenomenon. He is best known for his
contributions in approximating periodic functions as a infinite series of sines and cosines. For 10 points,
identify this French thinker who developed a law of thermal conductivity and whose namesake series are
used to decompose periodic functions.
ANSWER: Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier
Multiplying one of these by itself, integrating from negative L to L and multiplying by one over L
gives a useful identity involving the sum of the squares of their coefficients; that identity is used
alongside one of these in order to solve the Basel problem. They can be smoothened by applying an
expression involving the Lanczos sigma factor; that method is used to eliminate the (*) Gibbs
phenomenon, which occurs when they are calculated around discontinuities. One commonly-derived
example of these constructs has a coefficient of four over n pi when n is odd, and zero when even; that one
evaluates to a square wave. They are generally an infinite sum of sine and cosine functions. For 10 points,
name these series, which are decompositions of complex oscillating functions into an infinite series of
simpler ones.
ANSWER: Fourier series [do NOT accept "Fourier transform", but DO accept Fourier expansion o Fourier decomposition; just the word "Fourier" is acceptable after "series", but should be prompted before]
The convergence of these entities is determined by the Dini Test. One way to find this series is to integrate
the product of a function with e raised to negative two i times pi times x, though the coefficients can also be
found by integrating the product of a function with sine and cosine functions of various wavelengths. The
result allows any wave to be broken down into a sum of sinusoidal waves. Name this approximation of
periodic functions using trig functions.
ANSWER: Fourier series or transform
Taking this function on a member of a finite abelian group returns a member of the group
that is the Pontryagin dual of the original group. The space of all functions whose derivatives are
rapidly decreasing has the property that this operation is an automorphism; that space is named
for Schwartz. The integral from negative infinity to infinity of the square of a function is equal to
that same integral of this operation of that function, squared, according to Parseval's theorem.
Like a related operation named for Laplace, it takes convolutions to products and takes inputs
from the time domain to the frequency domain. For 10 points, name this operation which takes
an input and resolves it into a series of frequencies, a transform named for a French
mathematician.
ANSWER: Fourier transform
Over the space of Schwartz functions, this operation is an endomorphism. This operation taken on the
extension of a function is the subject of the Poisson summation formula, and Hankel generalized this
operation to radial functions. This operation is unitary by Parseval's theorem, and the Cooley-Tukey
algorithm is used to implement a "fast" version of this operation. Along with the Laplace transform, it is
often used to analyze differential equations. Also useful in analog signal processing, FTP, name this
transform that takes a function to its frequency domain, which is useful in decomposing waves and is named
for a French mathematician.
ANSWER: Fourier Transform
The box count method of a type of dimension analysis named after these objects is being researched as a
possible tool for the prognosis of cancer. The Menger sponge, in addition to being a super-object for all
compact one-dimensional objects, is a three-dimensional one of these. Another one of these has a Hausdorff
dimension of 3 and is known as the dragon curve. The Pythagoras tree is a shape-replacement example of
these. More famous examples include the Julia sets, which occur in the one of these known as the
Mandelbrot set. Name these infinitely self-similar patterns, exemplified by the Sierpinski triangle and the
Koch snowflake.
ANSWER: fractals
The Hutchinson operator of an iterated function system corresponds to one of these, while the escape-time
ones are defined by a recurrence relation at each point in space. One of these is a curve whose range
contains the entire unit square and is called the Peano curve, while another one is created by repeatedly
deleting the middle thirds of an interval and is called the Cantor set. All of them are self-similar, and they
are quantified by Hausdorff dimensions. For 10 points, name these geometrical objects that can be split into
parts that are reduced-size copies of the whole, a famous example of which is the Mandelbrot set.
ANSWER: fractals
Misiurewicz points are found on the boundaries of one of these shapes, which is seen after marking
all numbers c on the complex plane for which, starting with 0, infinite application of z-squared plus c
doesn-t diverge. Removing 7/27 ("seven twenty-sevenths") of a cube is the first step of constructing
one of these shapes named after Menger. Objects of this type can have non-integer (*) Hausdorff
dimension, and one can be found by coloring odd numbers on Pascal's triangle; that one is named for
Sierpinski. For ten points, identify these generally self-similar, space-filling figures like the Koch Snowflake
and Mandelbrot Set.
ANSWER: fractals
Some techniques that can generate these mathematical objects include the L-system and strange
attractors. Many of these entities can be created via infinite iterations of a recursive equation.
Famous examples of these figures include the Menger sponge, (*) Cantor set, and the Koch snowflake.
For 10 points, name these self-similar geometric figures, developed by Benoit Mandelbrot [ben-wah mahndel-broh], that contain infinitely many smaller copies of themselves.
ANSWER: fractals
The Hausdorff dimensions of these objects are greater than their topological dimensions. Examples of
these objects include the Menger sponge and the Sierpinski triangle, and types of them, such as the Cantor
set, can be created by infinitely iterating a recursive equation. These objects exhibit self-similarity on very
small scales, and resemble natural features like coastline and snowflakes. For 10 points, identify these
geometric spaces named by Benoit Mandelbrot, which contain infinitely smaller copies of themselves.
ANSWER: fractals
These objects can be generated by Hutchinson operators such as iterated function systems. A plot of the
convergence of Newton's method in the complex plane is one of these objects which were introduced in the
paper "How Long is The Coastline of Britain?" Many of these objects can be imaged using the escape-time
algorithm. Almost all Julia sets are these objects which have non-integral dimension, and examples of these
objects include the Koch snowflake and Sierpinski's triangle. For 10 points, name these geometrical objects
which are self-similar, such as the Mandlebrot set.
ANSWER: fractals
These objects were used by Pietronero and his team in 1987 to attempt to model distributions of
galaxies. The creation of these objects can be achieved by using an L-System, although Iterated
Function Systems are much more common. Trajectories of Brownian motion and Levy Flight can be
modeled using these entities, and the earliest discoverer of these objects used them to map the (*)
coastline of Britain. Many of these patterns are defined recursively, and have a finite area and an infinite
perimeter. The Menger Sponge, the Sierpinski Triangle, and the Koch Snowflake are all, for ten points,
what geometric figures first created by Benoit Mandelbrot.
ANSWER: fractals
One example of this construct is Gosper Island, which tessellates the plane, and the multi- type of this
construct is used to describe systems which require a spectrum of exponents to model their scaling rather
than a constant. One of the standard types can be generated by repeatedly moving halfway towards a
randomly selected vertex of a triangle or by shading the even numbers in an infinite Pascal's Triangle. Any
standard type of this is linear when a log-log graph is made of repetitions vs scale. Examples include the
Cantor Set, Sierpinski sieve, and Koch Snowflake. Identify these self-similar constructs with fractional
dimension described by Benoit Mandelbrot.
ANSWER: fractals
Daniel White and Paul Nylander constructed a three dimensional variety of one of these entities using
spherical coordinates called a "bulb." A type of derivative named for these entities can be used to model
Fick's second law in an alternative manner. One of these entities named for Newton is a boundary set in the
complex plane derived from his root finding method. Examples of these entities include the Koch
Snowflake, the Sierpinski Triangle, and the Mandelbrot Set. For 10 points, name these mathematical
constructs which consist of self-similar patterns.
ANSWER: Fractals
Examples of these figures with non-integer Hausdorff dimensions include Barnsley's fern and the
Gosper island. One type of this figure is the boundary between the prisoner set and escape set of a
sequence of iterations, of a function of a complex number; that type of this entity is the Julia set.
Benoit Mandelbrot is considered the founder of the study of these things. The (*) Koch snowflake and
Sierpinski triangle are examples of these figures, whose perimeter is addressed by the "shoreline paradox."
For 10 points, name these self-similar figures.
ANSWER: fractal
The L-system can generate these entities, as it is capable of describing many iterated function
systems. The most famous example of these is defined in terms of whether points on the complex
plane, when iteratively squared, are bounded. The Hilbert curve is a (*) space-filling one of these.
Examples of these include the Menger sponge, the Sierpinski carpet, and the Koch snowflake. For 10
points, name these self-similar geometric structures exemplified by the Mandelbrot set.
ANSWER: fractal
A coastline shares these shapes' property of having increasingly longer lengths when measured with
shorter and shorter rulers. Because of that property, when these shapes have a depth of infinity, they have
both an infinite perimeter and a finite area. Examples of these shapes include the Sierpinski gasket, the
Koch Snowflake, which is created by successively adding triangles to each side of an equilateral triangle,
and the Mandelbrot set. For 10 points, name these shapes which exhibit self-similarity on large scales.
ANSWER: fractals
Graphing one of these objects versus scale on a log-log plot yields a straight line with the slope equalling
this object's namesake dimension. A related quantity that characterizes these objects is the topological
dimension, which is always smaller than the Hausdorff dimension. In addition to space-filling curves and
Julia sets, the most famous example of these objects is named for a mathematician who studied the coastline
of Britain. They include the Sierpinski gasket, the Koch snowflake, and the Mandelbrot set. For 10 points,
name these self-similar patterns that, at every scale, contain smaller copies of themselves.
ANSWER: fractals
One method of developing a landscape named for these objects is to employ the random midpoint
displacement algorithm. One of their original developers applied them to modeling the coastline of Britain.
They are characterized by having a topological dimension less than their Hausdorff dimension, and some of
them are named for Moore, Julia, and Koch. They exhibit some form of self-similarity. One of the most
famous examples of these involves removing the central equilateral triangle from each equilateral triangle
in a figure repeatedly, named the Serpinski triangle. For 10 points, name these repeating geometric figures
developed by Benoit Mandelbrot.
ANSWER: fractals
These figures can be obtained by the diamond-square algorithm or the Hutchinson operator. One of the
escape-time types of these figures is named after a burning ship, and one of the random types is created by a
self-avoiding walk. Strange attractors named for Henon and Lorenz are examples of these figures, which
have a Hausdorff dimension larger than their topological dimension. The author of How Long Is the Coast
of Britain? coined the term for these figures. FTP name these self-similar figures exemplified by the Koch
snowflake and Sierpinski triangle.
ANSWER: fractals
Distances measured on this class of shapes are often in ratios given by one of the Feigenbaum [FIE-genbaum] constants, and these can often be defined by affine [ah-FINE] transformations, as is done for a
Barnsley's fern. One common method of generation involves applying random numbers to an iterated
function system, while another involves quadratic recurrence equations in the complex plane such as z
squared plus c. Examples include the dragon curve, Koch snowflake, and several shapes named after
Waclaw [VAHTS-wahf] Sierpinski [sir-PINS-kee]. Their dimension generally is not an integer, and these
shapes exhibit self-similarity. Name these shapes that visualize a Julia set or Mandelbrot set.
ANSWER: fractal
The "dangerous bend" symbol was used in a textbook from this country to warn students of
upcoming difficult passages. A man from this country attacked logicism by arguing induction could
not be derived from logical axioms in his book Science and Hypothesis and called the idea of
transfinite numbers a "disease" which mathematicians need to be cured of. A group here wrote a
series of books under a single (*) pseudonym that attempted to rigorously ground all mathematics in set
theory. In 1900 this country hosted the congress where Bertrand Russell was introduced to the work of
Georg Cantor via Giuseppe Peano. The same year, a man who was not from this country delivering a

twentieth century mathematicians. For 10 points, name this country home to the group Nicolas Bourbaki

ANSWER: France
This concept is central to an interpretation of statistics that becomes necessary when situations do not have
a natural probability that can be exactly calculated based on the setup of a problem. In an experiment, the
expected value equals the sum of the quantity of all the products of the relative type of this, multiplied by
their associated values. This term is used as an adjective for the polygon that is a line graph equivalent to a
histogram. The relative type of this is calculated by dividing the absolute type by the total number of trials

When invoking these structures in x86 (x-eighty-six), one must first back up registers like EBX onto the
stack and then use the call instruction. A common technique inlines them and it is common in some
languages to "overload" them. When lacking in a bound type they are known as "void," while normally they
take in a arguments or parameters and have a return value. For 10 points, name this programming construct
that has inputs and outputs.
ANSWER: function [or procedure; or method; or subroutine]
When these entities are paired with free variables bound in their environment, they are known as
closures. Evaluation strategies for them include call-by-need and call-by-reference. Many languages require
you to declare their prototype, which includes their argument and return types. Variables created inside of
them have a local scope. For 10 points, name these entities in computer programming that consist of a
block of code that performs a specific task.
ANSWER: functions [or methods; or subroutines; or procedures; or subprograms]
At the assembly level, invoking these entities pushes the old frame pointer onto the stack. Side effects occur
when these entities modify the value of a global variable. Scheme and Lisp are examples of programming
languages named for these entities. Many languages support ad hoc polymorphism by allowing you to
create many of these entities with the same name in a process called overloading. When these entities refer
to themselves, recursion ensues. For 10 points, name these entities that accept parameters and have return
values.
ANSWER: functions [or methods or subroutines or procedures or routines or callable units]
An important division of these idenfities those that are primitive recursive. Transcendental ones
are not expressible in a finite number of simple operations. Famous ones include those of Lame

Mathematicians using the name Nicolas Bourbaki classified these entities into surjections, bijections, and
injections, and these entities can be combined by using the output of one as the input of another in a process
called composition. Injections are also called the one-to-one type of these, and whether an inverse one of
these exists can be determined using the horizontal line test. For 10 points, identify this type of relation
which can be classified using the vertical line test in which each element of the domain corresponds to
exactly one element in the range.
ANSWER: functions
In C# (c sharp), delegates act as references to these things. Their contents are duplicated for
increased performance at the cost of size when they are inlined. Closures are examples of these that
can be treated like objects. Virtual ones can be overridden in object oriented programming. These

Pathological examples of these include the Blancmange and the Weierstrass [VY-ur-shtrass] ones. When
these can be expressed as an algorithm they are called computable, and when these can always be expressed
locally as power series they are classified as analytic. Other ways to classify these mathematical objects are
based on whether or not their image includes their entire codomain and whether any element in their image
is used more than once; those classifications are surjective and injective, respectively, which are also called
"onto" and "one-to-one". Name these mappings more specific than relations, which have the restriction that
each member of the domain can correspond to at most one member of the range.
ANSWER: functions [accept map(ping)s before "mappings"; prompt on relations before "relations"]
One way of denoting these mathematical objects is the name of the object colon a set right arrow
another set. Combining several of these entities to form a new one is known as (*) "composition" and
they are sometimes called a map. These entities can be surjective if their image equals their co-domain and
they are bijective under more stringent conditions. Since these entities can only have one output for each
input, one simple way of testing for them is the vertical line test. For 10 points, name this type of
mathematical entity typically written in the form f(x) ("f of x").
ANSWER: function [prompt on map before mentioned]
In C# (c sharp), delegates act as references to these things. Their contents are duplicated for increased

ANSWER: function [or method; or procedure; or subroutine]
According to complex analysis, if these entities are holomorphic, then they are also analytic. An
example of this type of entity that exhibits fractal properties is named the Minkowski question mark,
which is also known as the slippery devil's staircase. If one of these entities has an image equivalent
to its codomain, then it is classified as onto, or surjective. When they involve one variable going to
one other variable, their graphs always pass the vertical line test, and if their graphs also pass the
horizontal line test then they are called one-to-one. Name these relations in which each input taken
from the domain corresponds to exactly one output taken from the range.
ANSWER: functions
The z transform of the impulse response yields a representation of linear, time-invariant systems as a
transfer one of these things. Maps and operators are other terms used to refer to these things. The set of
values for which these things are defined is there domain; those that have only one element in their range
for every element in their domain are known as one-to-one. The negative of the input is equal to the
negative of the output for odd examples of these things. For 10 points, identify these things that relate
inputs and outputs.
ANSWER: function
These things are defined by being left-total and right-unique. A set of these things is denoted by "raising"
one set to the power of another set. They are typically denoted by a name followed by a colon, a set, an
arrow, and another set. The arity of one of these things is the number of arguments it accepts. These things
are said to be "partial" rather than "total" if they are not defined on their entire domain. A circle-symbol
between two of these things denotes composition. These relations are single-valued, and thus pass the
vertical line test. For 10 points, name these relations that map each input to exactly one output, examples of
which are "sine" and "logarithm".

Typing in this paradigm may be accomplished by the Hindley-Milner algorithm, and the Curry-Howard
isomorphism connects well-typed programs in this paradigm to proofs. One procedure in this paradigm is
called currying. This paradigm is inspired by the lambda calculus and must implement instances of iteration
as forward recursion. Pure forms of this paradigm ban side effects; instead, state is simulated using monads.
For 10 points, name this programming paradigm that contrasts with imperative programming, named for its
choice of first-order objects, languages employing which include ML and Lisp.
ANSWER: functional programming
These frameworks commonly use a form of lazy evaluation known as graph reduction, and deforestation is
commonly applied to programs written in them. Intuitionist type theory is useful in understanding these
languages, which are corresponded to proofs via the Curry-Howard isomorphism. Side effects are
completely avoided in the pure form of these languages, which are based heavily in extensions of lambda
calculus. Monads are used to store states in this programming paradigm, which replaces iterative structures
with forward recursion. For 10 points, identify this programming paradigm exemplified by Haskell and
Lisp, which is often contrasted with imperative programming.

the later of which implies that every polynomial of degree n has n complex roots.
ANSWER: fundamental
Proofs of this result sometimes make use of Liouville's Theorem that a bounded entire complex function
must be constant. An early proof of this by Argand was based on earlier work by D-Alembert, while the
most famous proof of it was actually faulty because it assumed the Jordan curve theorem. Early arguments
over it were faulty because they did not use complex numbers or, in Leibniz's case, did not realize that the
square root of i could be expressed in the form a + b i, and thus failing in the case of x to the fourth power
plus one. Nearly proven in Gauss's dissertation, name this theorem that states that every polynomial of
degree n with complex coefficients has n complex roots.
ANSWER: Fundamental Theorem of Algebra [prompt on partial answer]
One proof of this theorem takes the normal closure of a finite extension and then considers a 2-Sylow
subgroup of that extension's Galois group. This theorem follows from continuity and Picard's little
theorem. Another proof considers the function 1-over-f, which is entire and bounded, and thus must
be constant by Liouville's theorem. Since algebraic extensions have finite subextensions, this theorem
is equivalent to there being no (*) nontrivial finite extension of the complex numbers. This theorem
implies that irreducible complex polynomials are linear, and thus non-constant complex polynomials are a
product of linear factors. For 10 points, name this theorem stating that nth degree polynomials have n
complex roots.
ANSWER: fundamental theorem of algebra
A topological proof for this statement relies on the contradiction that two curves with different winding

bounded, analytic functions are constant, it can be used to prove this statement. An early proof for it came
from Gauss' doctoral dissertation, and it can be equivalently stated as "the field of complex numbers is
closed." It states that for a polynomial of degree m with complex coefficients, the polynomial has at most m

states that every polynomial of n degrees has n complex roots.
ANSWER: fundamental theorem of algebra
One proof of this theorem uses Liouville's theorem, that any bounded function differentiable on the
complex plane is constant. An attempt to prove this theorem by d-Alembert was incomplete, and it was
eventually proven by Gauss. It implies that every algebraic extension of the real numbers is isomorphic to
the field of either real or complex numbers. In 1806 Argand stated this theorem for complex coefficients. A

ANSWER: fundamental theorem of algebra
The so-called lemma of d'Alembert [DAH-lum-ber] is an incomplete proof of this statement that can be

interest. One corollary of this statement is that every polynomial with only real roots can be written a linear
combination of linear and quadratic terms. For 10 points, name this theorem that states that every

One proof of this theorem exploits the fact that there cannot exist two homotopic curves that don-t
cross zero with different winding numbers. This theorem can be proven with a theorem stating that a
bounded function over the complex plane is a consta nt, named for Liouville. D-Alembert's proof of it
is incomplete, [*] Gauss tried proving this theorem geometrically, and Argand's proof was the first to

This theorem implies that the field of complex numbers is the algebraic closure of the field of real numbers.
Gauss's 1799 geometric proof of this theorem had a topological gap, and Cauchy wrote the first textbook
containing the proof for this theorem in 1821. Multiplicity needed to be taken into account when counting

This figure is formed by graphing y=(1/x) with a domain restriction to avoid the asymptote, then
rotating it in 3 dimensions around the x axis. Integrating under the curve shows that the volume
approaches pi, while the surface area is greater than two pi times the natural log of the upper bound
of integration. This is sometimes called the painter's paradox (*) as painting an infinite area requires an

while the minimax theorem from this field was developed by one of its founders, John (*) von Neumann. In
one problem from this field, a Nash equilibrium is reached when all involved decide to defect. A Mexican
standoff and zero-sum are examples of the title situation from this field. The prisoner's dilemna is a situation

The "extensive" version of this field includes the "move by nature," in which individuals do not affect
the outcome. Other types of this study where the people involved do not matter are called symmetric
and asymmetric. Founded by Oskar Morgenstern and John (*) von Neumann, some of its situations

This field's contributions to evolutionary biology include formalizing a situation in which no mutant can
invade a population, "evolutionary stability." A thought experiment in this field hinges on two suspects

The Lanczos method provides a good approximation of this construct due to the convergence of one

property distinguishes that method from the Spouge and Stirling methods for approximating this

Kenneth De Jong introduced crowding methods to deal with one problem in these algorithms, of
which Goldberg et. Al developed a "messy" variant. Their inventor proved their effectiveness by
finding an approximation for a function xi of s comma t + 1 in terms of xi of s comma t while proving
the Schema Theorem. These algorithms should be used instead of hill climbing when applied to a (*)
surface with many hills and valleys. These algorithms take an initial set of candidate programs, then
eliminate the weakest based on a fitness function and create a new set via crossover and mutation. For 10
points, name this type of algorithm that finds an optimal solution to a problem using techniques inspired by
natural selection.
ANSWER: genetic algorithms
Variance in the "building blocks" of these algorithms gives rise to collateral noise, which usually
dominates motion among schemata. In a "simple" case considered by Vose, the contraction-mapping
theorem is replaced by a variant of the Lyapunov stability criterion to describe the convergence of
these algorithms when a certain function is linear. To guarantee that they converge, an "elitist"
operator must often be used, so as not to preserve the distance function. DeJong proposed
deterministic crowding to prevent premature convergence; this can also be achieved via a (*)
replacement phase with a selection rule based on simulated annealing. These algorithms see use to solve
problems with an analytically-insoluble fitness landscape, like the traveling salesman problem. For 10

ANSWER: Kurt Godel
Specific cases of this theorem are much easier to prove if the theory satisfies three conditions named
for Hilbert, Bernays, and Lob. One lemma used in the proof of this statement claims that for any
function, there exists a sentence that implies that function taken on the number of the sentence; that
is the diagonalization lemma. The proof of this theorem involves uniquely encoding all statements in
a theory in its formulator's namesake numbers, and then constructing a (*) self-referential statement.
This theorem states that any sufficiently strong theory will have statements that are true but unprovable. For
10 points, name this pair of theorems about the limitations of the foundations of mathematics, proven by
Kurt Godel.
ANSWER: Godel's incompleteness theorems (accept "first" or "second" before "incompleteness theorem")
Porgozelski claimed to have proven this statement in 1977, though his method was not considered valid.
Schrinelmann verified the conjecture for n = three hundred thousand, though the upper bound has since
been lowered to seven primes. Its modern form differs from it's initial conception, when the number one
was considered prime and thus odd numbers were also investigated. It's weaker from differs in that odd
numbers greater than nine are considered, and a stronger form of that is Levy's conjecture. For 10 points,
name this conjecture named after a Prussian mathematician which states that all even numbers greater than
four are the sum of at most two primes.
ANSWER: Goldbach Conjecture
Utilizing the circle method, Hardy and Littlewood proved the weaker version of this statement, though their
proof required the grand Riemann hypothesis to be true. Vinogradov provided a direct proof of its weak
version, a result similar to Levy's statement. Chen Jing Run used a weighted sieve method that improved on
the work of Brun and Selberg to give a new upper bound for this problem. This statement is equivalent to
the claim that for every positive integer m, there exist primes p and q such that phi of p plus phi of q equals
two times m, where phi is the totient function. The aforementioned weak version states that every odd
number greater than 7 can be written as the sum of three odd primes. For 10 points, identify this unproven
statement whose strong version states that every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of
two primes.
ANSWER: Goldbach's Strong Conjecture
A paper by Bamberg relates this theorem to the crystallographic restriction theorem, and it is classified as a
Schinzel hypothesis H-sub-n in analytic number theory. Major steps in solving it may be Chen's theorem,
which uses the Selberg Sieve, and a result by Schnirelmann that uses a Brun sieve. Hardy and Littlewood
showed that its weak form holds true if the Riemann Hypothesis is true, and Vinogradov determined a
sufficiently large odd number for its weak form to hold true. Its simplicity has led cranks such as G.
Spencer-Brown and H.A. Pogorzelski to claim proofs of it. Its current formulation was stated by Euler,
though it is still named for a teacher of his. FTP, identify this unproven mathematical theorem which states

shortest side in a 36-72-72 triangle and it is the quotient of the length of a diagonal to
the side length in a regular(*) pentagon. This number, which is one more than its reciprocal,
is the ratio of a line segment to its longer section when cut in extreme and mean ratio. For ten

This number is equal to the square root of the quantity of one plus its own square root, and it can be
represented as a standard continued fraction using only the number one. It is also equal to two times the
cosine of the quantity pi over five, which is why it can be used to compare distances within a pentagon. It
solves the quadratic x squared minus x minus one equals zero, and it gives the limit of the

In Java, the two reserved but unused keywords are const and this keyword. In C languages, its action is
performed non-locally by the setjmp keyword. A 1968 letter by E. W. Dijkstra stated that this statement
"should be abolished from all 'higher level- programming languages." The title of that article was "[this
keyword] considered harmful." Usage of this statement can lead to disorganized "spaghetti code." For 10
points, name this programming keyword that performs an unconditional jump to a specific label or line of
code and whose inverse is the rarely-used parody, the "comefrom" statement.
ANSWER: goto statement [accept unconditional jump before it is read; prompt jump before it is read]
The Bohm-Jacopini Theorem states that this statement is unnecessary in a language with sequence,
conditional, and while statements. It is often used to move out of a loop to an error handler, and tail calls
are an alternative to them. In Java it is an unusable reserved keyword. A paper that argued that this
statement made code unclear was written by Dijkstra [DYKE-straw] and was called this "Considered
Harmful." For 10 points, name this statement which uses labels to jump to a given line in a program.
ANSWER: GOTO
Edsger Dijkstra famously wrote a letter in which this operation was "Considered Harmful", advocating
structured programming instead. When dealing with finite state machines, switch/case structure is generally
considered preferable to the use of this command, but exception handling often has to use this operation.
Over-reliance on this command results in "spaghetti code". For 10 points, name this command which is
used to transfer control, usually by telling the program at what label it should continue running, a parody of
which is INTERCAL's "COME FROM".

In physics, the opposite of this operation performed on the potential difference function gives the electric

the dot product for divergence and with the cross product for curl notation. In vector calculus, the dot
product of a function under this operation, the vector sum of the partial derivatives of a scalar function, with
a unit vector gives the directional derivative. FTP, name this term along whose concentration type occurs in
simple diffusion.
ANSWER: Gradient Accept del until mentioned
At every point P in the domain of a function f of x comma y, this function is normal to the level curve

this operator symbolized del.
ANSWER: gradient [prompt on del]
On Riemannian manifolds, this operator gives a field equivalent to the musical isomorphism sharp of the
function's differential. Fourier's Law gives the rate of heat transfer through a material as proportional to the
negative result of this operator applied to a temperature field. The Jacobian of this operator is the Hessian,
and the Jacobian is itself formed of transposes of this operator. The curl of the result of this operator is
always zero, and it's divergence is equal to zero for harmonic functions and known as the Laplacian, which
is sometimes symbolized by this operator squared. FTP, name this operator which points in the direction of
steepest ascent for a scalar field and returns a vector consisting of a function's partial derivatives, generally
symbolized with a nabla, a down-pointing triangle.
ANSWER: Gradient (prompt on "del" or "nabla")
When the dot product is taken between this and any unit vector, the directional derivative is obtained. Line
integrals through it are path independent, as shown by its namesake theorem, which is also known as the
fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals. The tangent plane to any level surface is defined with
this as the normal vector. The maximum value of the directional derivative at a point is its magnitude and is
in the same direction as its vector. For 10 points, name this vector field denoted by nabla f and defined as
the vector field whose components are the partial derivatives of f.

One class of them correspond to irreducible root systems; that class has extended and affine varieties, the
latter sort of which can describe Cartan matrices. The Hadwiger conjecture concerns these objects, as does
the Robertson-Seymour theorem. Some functors have these objects as domains, and in that situation they

This mathematical operation can be expressed as a linear combination using Bezout's [bay-zoo-s] identity.
This equals the number of lattice points crossed by a line from the origin to the coordinates of the two input
values. If this value is one, then its inputs are called relatively prime. This value found by the Euclidean
[yoo-KLIH-dee-un] algorithm equals the product of two numbers divided by their least common multiple.
This operation can also be evaluated by multiplying the shared prime factors of a set of numbers. Name this
largest value that goes into all of a set of numbers.
ANSWER: greatest common factor (accept gcf, greatest common divisor, or gcd; accept highest or largest in place of greatest)
The natural numbers form a complete distributive lattice with this operation corresponding to meet.
In a principal ideal domain, this operation corresponds to finding the generator of the ideal
generated by two elements. For integers x and y, this is the smallest positive integer that can be
written as "a-x plus b-y", according to Bezout's identity. Performing this operation on two integers is
equivalent to performing it on the smaller of the two integers and the (*) difference between them. That
fact is the basis for the Euclidean algorithm, which computes this quantity more efficiently than first
computing the prime factorization of both inputs. For a natural number n and zero, this value is n, while for
two relatively prime numbers, this value is one. For 10 points, name this value which is the largest positive
integer that divides two given numbers.
ANSWER: greatest common divisor [or GCD; or greatest common factor; or highest common factor; or GCF; or HCF]
One algorithm for computing this number takes two numbers and calls itself with the second number and
an expression involving the floor of their quotient. Besides Euclid's algorithm, a way of computing it
involves factoring two numbers and multiplying the terms that appear in both factorizations. It is equal to
the product of two numbers divided by their least common multiple. For two prime numbers, it equals one.
For 10 points, name this largest number which evenly divides two integers.
ANSWER: greatest common divisor [or GCD; or greatest common factor; or GCF]
One method for finding this quantity is through an algorithm whose worst-case is when the inputs
are Fibonacci numbers. Bezout's lemma states that this value is the smallest positive integer which
can be written as a linear combination of this function's inputs. The value of this function over two
variables can be found with the (*) Euclidean Algorithm, and two numbers are relatively prime if this
function of them returns the value of one. For two integers x and y, this function equals xy divided by the
LCM of x and y. For ten points, identify this function, which gives the largest integer that divides a
collection of numbers.
ANSWER: greatest common divisor (or greatest common factor, also accept highest for greatest)
Bezout's Identity means that for integers a and b, there exist integers u and v such that au plus bv
equals this value for a and b. It can be computed using an algorithm that is based on the fact that this
of a and b is equal to that of b and the (*) remainder of a divided by b. That algorithm is named for
Euclid. If two integers are relatively prime, then this value for those two integers is one. For 10 points,
name this value that is the largest factor shared by two numbers, which for the example of 12 and 18 is 6.
ANSWER: greatest common divisor [or GCD; or greatest common denominator; or greatest common factor; or GCF]
The existence of this function for two elements of a ring ensures that the ring is a principal ideal domain.
This value can be found by beginning a sequence with the two given numbers with the larger one first and
repeatedly adding to the sequence with the difference between the second to last number and the largest
multiple of the last number that will leave a positive result. That process is known as the Euclidean
algorithm, and if this value is one for two numbers, then the numbers are said to be relatively prime. It can
also be calculated by dividing the product of two numbers by their least common multiple. Given the prime
factorization of two numbers, this value can be found by multiplying together the set of their common prime
factors. Name this value which is the largest value that divides two numbers.
ANSWER: greatest common factor [or greatest common divisor; or GCF; or GCD]
Stein's Algorithm computes this value recursively and runs slightly faster than another recursive algorithm
that iteratively subtracts the largest possible multiple of the smaller number that is less than or equal to the
larger; that latter algorithm is named for Euclid. A slower approach to computing this value is to multiply
all shared prime factors with multiplicity. A fraction is in lowest terms if this value for its numerator and
denominator is one. This value is equal to the product of two numbers divided by their least common
multiple. For ten points, identify this largest integer by which two numbers can be evenly divided.
ANSWER: greatest common divisor or greatest common factor (accept gcd or gcf, accept equivalents like "highest" or "largest" in place of "greatest")
This operation can be defined as the sum of the Euler totient functions for each natural number that is a
factor of both inputs. For two integers a and b, there exists a linear combination of a and b that is equal this
operation applied to a and b according to Bezout's identity. If this operation applied to two integers yields
one, then they are coprime to each other. A recursive algorithm to perform this operation involves dividing
each remainder by the divisor, and was formulated by Euclid. The product of the least common multiple and
this operation yields the product of the two inputs. For 10 points, name this operation which finds the
largest number that divides both inputs.
ANSWER: greatest common factor [or greatest common divisor; or GCF; or GCD]
Hassler Whitney created an ordered pair called a matroid to show that these methods are correct if
they feature an underlying exchange argument. Typically, one may prove that these procedures are
correct by considering a dynamic programming solution to a problem, then showing that there need
be only one choice in each instance of a subproblem. These kinds of methods are exemplified by (*)
Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm, both of which make minimum spanning trees. They are most
often illustrated with a change-making algorithm. For 10 points, name these algorithms that always take the
locally optimal step.
ANSWER: greedy algorithm
Equivalent descriptions of these objects can be passed between by a finite number of Tietze
transformations. The set of all continuous deformation congruence classes of paths in a manifold is one type
of these objects. The largest prime power that divides the order of one of these objects is also the order of
one of its subsets according to one of Sylow's theorems, which is a partial converse of Lagrange's theorem.
Every finite one is isomorphic to a subset of the symmetric one according to Cayley's theorem. Sometimes
defined as a monoid with an inverse element, these objects are a set with an identity element and an inverse
for every element that is closed under a binary operation which is associative. For 10 points, name these
objects that, when their operation possesses commutativity, are known as "abelian," and which are studied
in abstract algebra along with rings and fields.
ANSWER: groups
To apply the cohomology theory of these objects to the study of finite-dimensional central division
algebras over a field, one studies the Brauer type of them. The free product is the coproduct in the
category of these objects. The Burnside problem asks about finitely generated types of them. P-types
of them are of interest in their structure theory, where (*) Sylow's theorem is a key result. The
fundamental type of them is an important algebraic topological invariant. One can always embed one of
these in a symmetric one of these, a result named for Cayley. A divisibility result for their order is named
Lagrange's theorem. For 10 points, name this basic algebraic structure consisting of a set closed and
containing an inverse and identity under an associative operation.
ANSWER: groups
Novikov proved that the word problem for these objects is sometimes undecidable. Special types of these
are called periodic or torsion ones, which are the subject of Burnside's problem. The Cayley graph is a
method of representing these, and another one of these can be represented as a 194-by-194 character table,
the Fischer-Greiss Monster. They may act on a set, usually as what may be called "symmetries" of that set,
and functions from one to another that preserve their structure are called homomorphisms. Characterized by
closure, associativity, and inverses, those that are commutative are also called abelian. FTP, name these
algebraic structures, distinct from rings and fields.
ANSWER: Groups
HNN extensions can be used to prove that every constructible one of these structures can be defined
using a finite presentation. A homomorphism from one of these structures to a general linear one of
them on a vector space is one of their namesake representations. If one of these structures possesses a
single element in its generating set it is said to be (*) cyclic. These structures are equivalent to monoids
which possess an inverse. The integers are one of these structures under addition, but not under
multiplication. For 10 points, name these algebraic structures characterized by a set and an operation which
together possess closure, associativity, an inverse element, and an identity element, whose commutative
varieties are named for Abel.
ANSWER: groups
One of these constructs is called perfect if it is equal to its own commutator. The purpose of the Holder
program was to classify a certain type of these. Those of odd order are solvable according to the FeitThompson theorem. Any one of these of prime order is also cyclic. Symmetric types of this algebraic
structure consist of permutations of a given number of elements. Examples of these include one that has a
194 by 194 character table created by Fisher and Greiss. One of these of order six is the smallest one of
these that is non-commutative. They must be associative and have an identity, inverses and a zero element,
and Abelian ones are commutative. For 10 points, name these algebraic structures that consist of a set and a
binary operation performed on that set.
ANSWER: groups
The Novikov-Boone-Britton Theorem proves the undecidability of the word problem for these
mathematical objects. The number of subsets fixed by their elements is proportional to the number
of orbits according to Burnside's Lemma. If "p to the n" is the largest power of prime p that divides
the order of one of these objects, then it contains a sub-object of size "p to the n" according to (*)
Sylow's Theorem. A sub-object of one of these objects must have an order that divides the order of the
original object according to Lagrange's Theorem. These objects are defined as monoids which include
inverse elements, and their namesake axioms include closure and the presence of an identity element. These
objects consist of a set and a single binary operation, and are called Abelian when they commute. For 10
points, name these mathematical objects studied in abstract algebra that are more general than a ring.
ANSWER: groups
The finite quotient types of these are isomorphic [eye-soe-MOR-fik] according to the Jordan-Holder
Theorem. The attempt to classify the finite simple examples of these left 26 exceptional ones known as
sporadic, and the ones containing all permutations of n symbols along with the composition operation are
classified as symmetric. In order to be classified as this, a system has to follow four given properties,
including having an identity and each element having an inverse, and the examples which are also
commutative are called abelian [uh-BEEL-yun]. Name these structures, some of which are cyclic, that are
defined by a set and a single operation.
ANSWER: groups
One type of these objects consists of all finite words built from a set; that is the free variety. They are
partitioned by their orbits under an action, and these mathematical structures can be represented by Cayley
graphs or Cayley tables. The types of these objects that represent the symmetries of a regular polygon are
known as dihedral ones, and those that can be generated by products of a single element are called cyclic. If
they are commutative, they are known as abelian. Name these mathematical structures that consist of a set
closed under a binary operation that is associative and possesses inverses and an identity.
ANSWER: groups
The Yoneda lemma in category theory generalizes a statement about these objects that suggests that
every one of these objects X is isomorphic to a subset of the symmetry one of these on X, a theorem
named for Cayley. Point ones are used to classify inorganic compounds for MO analysis. These
objects are called normal if they are self-conjugate. Those that look locally like a manifold, such as the
general linear one, are named for Sophus Lie. The center of one of these objects is a subset of it where
commutativity holds, so the center of one of these is Abelian. For 10 points, name these algebraic structures
with an invertible, associative binary operation.
ANSWER: groups
Locally compact examples of these algebraic structures can be assigned Haar measures. All possible
composition series of one of these objects are equivalent by the Jordan-Holder theorem. One class of these
has locally Euclidean structure and is named for Lie [LEE]. Another class of this type of object dictates the
solvability of polynomials and is named for Galois [gal-WAH]. As with many algebraic structures, the set
of commuting values in one of these is its center and one equal to its own center is Abelian. For 10 points,
name these mathematical structures, each of which consists of a set endowed an associated operation for
which there exist an identity and inverses.
ANSWER: groups
A relation between covering and the number of generators for a specific type of this object containing
cosets is Abhyankar's Conjecture. Sometimes defined as invertible monids, these structures are called
topological if they have the Hausdorff topology and are continuous. Their character, sometimes known as
the trace, is equal for ones in the same conjugacy class. The order of one contained in another must divide
the order of the containing one according to Lagrange's lemma. These are named for Lie [LEE] when their
operation is smooth. They're not rings, but when they commute, they are called Abelian. FTP, name these
mathematical structures, sets of elements and operations that are closed and associative and have an identity
and inverses.
ANSWER: groups
Components of this type developed in Ruby often make use of the Shoes toolkit. XAML is used to
create these parts of a program in WPF for .NET applications; WPF replaced the older WinForms
paradigm for creating these parts of programs. This part of a program comprises the "V" portion of
the MVP design pattern. Libraries to create these parts of applications in Java include (*) AWT and
Swing. Most libraries for these entities include widgets like labels, radio buttons and text boxes.
Command-line applications do not have these. For 10 points, name these parts of programs that use images
rather than text to handle user interaction.
ANSWER: Graphical User Interface Programs [or GUI ("gooey"); prompt on partial answers like "Use Interface" or "UI"]
Time constructible functions are functions whose output describe the time for this to occur. Sums of
two to the negative probability of this occurrence make up the transcendental omega numbers. Tibor Rado
devised a problem looking for setups responsible for the maximum number of ones before this happens.
That is the busy beaver problem. For linear bounded automata, this occurrence can be computed. A
diagonal proof showed that there is no general procedure for predicting if this will happen. That was shown
in a paper on the Entscheidungs problem by Alan Turing. If this does not happen, a machine will runs
forever. For 10 points, name this termination of a computation by a Turing machine.
ANSWER: halting [accept equivalents]
A corollary of this makes virus detection difficult, because it is impossible to tell if a program outputs its
own source code, and another corollary establishes that it is impossible to statically parse Perl. Its proof
usually makes use of the fact that a program can be its own input, and quantum computers cannot solve this
problem. Chaitin's constant gives the solution to this problem for a universal Turing Machine, but it is
uncomputable and effectively random. If this problem could be solved, all mathematical statements could
be proven or disproven, given sufficient time. Sometimes considered the computer version of Godel's
incompleteness theorem, for 10 points, name this undecidable problem formulated by Turning that asks for
a given input whether a particular algorithm will ever stop.
ANSWER: Halting Problem [Accept word forms that include halt]
Rice's theorem generalizes one result about this property to any non-trivial property about the
language recognized by a Turing machine. One number denoted capital omega determines the
probability of a program having this property; that is Chaitin's constant. In 1936, Turing
independently proved that there exists no (*) algorithm to determine if a program will do this, making the
problem of this property undecidable. For 10 points, name this property of programs which means that they
stop instead of running forever.
ANSWER: halting problem
Some proofs of this statement rely on the same contradiction inherent in the barber paradox. The first
proof of this statement adapted Cantor's diagonalization proof. Chaitin's omega constant gives a probability
for this statement. If this statement were true, then every recursively enumerable language would be
recursive. This statement can be used to prove, by reduction, Rice's theorem. This statement is required to
be true for busy beavers. Because this statement is usually cumbersome to work with, it is typically reduced
to Post's correspondence problem instead. For 10 points, name this undecidable decision problem that asks
if a given program will finish running.
ANSWER: halting problem [or halting theorem; or obvious equivalents, such as whether a program will halt or not before "will finish running" is read]
When the type of matrix named for this person is left multiplied by a skew-symmetric matrix, the
result is Hermitian. This mathematician's name comes second in the name of the theorem stating that
each square matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. This person is credited for the icosian
game, which involves finding a cycle on a dodecahedron that visits each vertex once, which is why
graph cycles which visit each node exactly once are named for him. He carved one of his equations
into Brougham Bridge in Dublin after being inspired to discover it by a walk over the bridge. Name
this Irish mathematician and physicist who developed the concepts of tensors and quaternions.
ANSWER: Sir William Rowan Hamilton
This man carved the equation i squared equals j squared equals k squared equal i j k equals negative 1 on
the side of a Dublin bridge after he found a solution to his quest to quantify an extension of complex
numbers to three dimensions. The reformulation of Newtonian mechanics named after this man studies the
evolution of a system in generalized coordinates through his namesake differential equations, and with
Cayley, he names a theorem about the characteristic polynomials of matrices. For ten points, name this Irish
mathematician, the discoverer of quaternions, who also gives his name to the quantum mechanical operator
corresponding to the total energy of a system.
ANSWER: William Rowan Hamilton
With Jacobi and Bellman, this man names an equation central to optimal control problems, and he names a
theorem which implies that a square matrix A satisfies its own characteristic polynomial, along with Cayley.
He names a cycle on a graph such that the path visits each vertex exactly once, and he is also the namesake
of an operator which is the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian operator and gives the total energy of a
system. Better known for the creation of a division ring where i squared, j squared, and k squared equal
negative one, for 10 points, identify this Irish mathematician who developed the mathematics of
quaternions.

These devices contain parallel concentric, or spiral, tracks, which are divided into blocks. The time it
takes the actuator arm to move the head to a track is the seek time of these devices. One type of failure in
these devices occurs when that read/write head comes into contact with a rotating platter, which is coated

commonly come in sizes of two point five and three point five inches.
ANSWER: hard disk drive [or HDD; or disk drive; or computer disk]
These devices are susceptible to a superparamagnetic limit. An important statistic of these devices is
their areal density. They come in 3.5 and 2.5 inch form factors. Their contents are divided into tracks,
cylinders, and sectors. A major component of their access time is seek time. These consist of platters over
which read/write heads move. Recently, some of these have been replaced by Solid-state drives which use
flash memory. For 10 points, name these devices that store files on a computer and have capacities
measured in gigabytes and terabytes.
ANSWER: hard drive [or hard disk]
Recent improvements in these devices include perpendicular recording and native command queuing. An
important metric in their performance is seek time and they have multiple rotating platters which are
manipulated by heads. Concentric circles on the platters are known as tracks, which have smaller parts
called sectors that can store 512 bytes. For 10 points, name this piece of hardware which stores the files on
a computer, which generally has more storage space than the no longer as common floppy disk.
ANSWER: hard drive [or hard disk drive; or HDD; or hard disk]
Central to this type of device is an actuator, also called a voice coil. On Windows machines, these
hardware pieces use FAT32 or NTFS file systems. Virtual memory allows the computer to store pages on
these as opposed to RAM. The use of multiple ones is allowed via RAID technology, and most modern ones
use the Serial ATA interface. For 10 points, name this piece of computer hardware, which consists of a
read-write head and a series of platters and has a capacity typically measured in gigabytes.

This British mathematician co-names a theorem stating that the normal order of the number of distinct
prime factors of "n" is approximately "log of log of n." This mathematician recounted a story in which he
complained that 1729 was a boring number, and he claimed that math is a "young man's game" in his A
Mathematician's Apology. He is the first namesake of a biological equation stating p-squared plus 2pq plus
q-squared equals 1. For ten points, identify this mathematician who "discovered" Ramanujan and formulated
a genetic principle independent of Wilhelm Weinberg.

This adjective describes a type of division that adds two points, one on a segment and one on the extension
of that segment, in a way that creates two proportions. It also describes functions f that satisfy del squared f
equals zero. This word names a diverging series equivalent to the quantity one minus x to the nth power
divided by the quantity one minus x. That series adds the reciprocals of the positive integers. To find the
type of mean described by this term, one takes the sum of the number's reciprocals and divides the number
of data points by that value. Give this adjective often used with mathematics concerning the study of sound
waves because of its connection to music.

This sort of range is formed from points ABCD if AC over CB equals AD over DB. This term is given to
any function that has continuous second partial derivatives and satisfies Laplace's equation. The angular
part of the solutions of Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates are called spherical this. This term
describes the series that is the sum of one over n for one to infinity. This type of mean is the reciprocal of
the mean of the reciprocals. For 10 points, name this term that in acoustics refers to frequencies that are
integer multiples of the fundamental and thus names the analysis of additively combined waves.
ANSWER: harmonics
The geometric type of this kind of function was originally developed for computer vision but is now used
in, among other applications, fingerprint recognition. A function of this type is used by the Rabin-Karp
algorithm to efficiently search for examples of plagiarism. Rainbow tables list pre-calculated outputs of
these functions, which in most practical examples have pairs of values that map to the same output, called a
collision. Algorithms to generate them include SHA-1 and MD5, which output an index based on the input,
called a "key"; those indices, which are also known by this term, can be listed in a map or table named for
them. Give this term associated with the tagging of objects using a pound sign.
ANSWER: hash(ing) function [accept hash table; accept hash tag]
The cuckoo type of this structure can be implemented using bipartite matching algorithms. To improve the
expected bounds into a worst case bound, its universal formulation can use randomization over a series of
2-way independent functions to reduce collisions with high probability. Having no collisions results in a
perfect type of this data structure. Knuth and others credit H.P. Luhn with its creation, though Open
Addressing and other related techniques were already known at the time. Though Knuth conducted a
famous analysis of the linear probing version, the chaining version has more practical bounds on adversarial
input, but the double version can improve upon linear probing. For 10 points, what is this symbol table data
structure that achieves O(1) operations using a function to map keys to memory addresses?
ANSWER: hashing [accept hash map, hash table and equivalents]
Bloom filters require a set of different functions that do this. In cryptography, algorithms that perform this
task should have a strong avalanche effect and include WHIRLPOOL, MD5, and the SHA family. Data
structures that use open addressing can perform this action several times to locate elements. For ten points,
name the action that turns any large element or piece of data into a single integer, often used in sets and

ANSWER: Hashing
These algorithms should be designed to be preimage resistant. They can be designed using the MerkleDamgard construction. When these algorithms are selected at random from a family, they are said to be
universal. To mathematically analyze these algorithms, one often makes the assumption abbreviated SUHA.
The modulo operator is used in the class of them based on the division method. A rolling one of these
algorithms is used in the Rabin-Karp string searching algorithm. They can be used to construct errordetecting codes called checksums, such as the cyclic redundancy check. Separate chaining and linear
probing can be used to resolve collisions in them. An example of these algorithms is MD5. For 10 points,
identify these functions that map a set of keys to a set of indexes and are used to sort unordered data for
easy lookup in a namesake table.
ANSWER: collision-resistant cryptographic hashing functions
Cater and Wegman introduced the notion of a class of these whose important property comes from
choosing one at random. Blake and Skein are two examples of these. Merkle-Damgard construction
creates these through compression schemes. Karp and Rabin introduced a (*) rolling example. One
technique chains them together. Examples used for cryptographic purposes include SHA-1 and MD5.
Ideally, these should have low collision rates and these are the basis for average time O(1) storage and
retrieval. They are used to make checksums which can be used to verify the integrity of a file. A common
use of these in programming is for storing data in their namesake tables. For 10 points, name these functions
that map data to a smaller key.

This term is used in an alternate name for dynamic memory allocation. A minimum spanning tree is found
more efficiently by Prim's algorithm when it uses the binary or Fibonacci type of this structure. This term is
used to describe the property of some trees in which each node has a key more extreme than its parent. This
term also describes a type of sorting which, like quicksort, is big O n log n. Name this tree-based data
structure.
ANSWER: heap
Because a Young Tableau consists of rows and columns of numbers that are sorted, functions
that search and extract the minimum value from these data structures are easily extended to such.
Implementing a priority queue using this data structure provides good performance for Dijkstra's
algorithm, especially when its Fibonacci type is used. An in-place sorting algorithm named for
these data structures has an average runtime of big O of n log n, combining the best properties of
insertion and merge sort, respectively. The binary type of these data structures must be complete
binary trees. For 10 points, name these data structures whose order property dictates that data
stored in a node must be less than or equal to all the node's descendants, so the smallest value is
the root node.
ANSWER: binary heaps [prompt on trees]
The bi-parental type of these objects allows for sublinear search. One type of these objects is composed of
several binomial substructures, while another that improves on that kind's runtime is named after Fibonacci.
Its minimum or maximum can generally be found in constant time, though most operations on it take log n
time. This structure can be used to implement a priority queue, and a process which involves repeatedly
removing the root element and then rearranging the structure is the sort named after this structure. For 10
points, name this type of tree that has the property that every child node is either greater or less than its
parent.
ANSWER: heaps
Fredman and Tarjan developed one type of this object that improves asymptotic running time for
algorithms, and allows for "lazy" evaluation of operations. Another variety of these objects increase
operational speed by introducing "corruptions". These structures are used in a sorting algorithm which
removes the maximal element from one of these structures, puts it at the end of the sorted list, and rebuilds
one of these structures; that algorithm has a better worst-case run time than quicksort. These structures are
trees which satisfy a namesake ordering property. For 10 points, name this data structure in which the key of
a child node is either greater than or equal to the key of its parent node.
ANSWER: heap
Carefully corrupting the keys of at most a certain number of values in this data structure allows for
five operations to have a constant amortized runtime in its soft variant. When implementing
smoothsort, the elements are stored in this kind of data structure based on Leonardo numbers. By
using these as internal traversal data structures along with adjacency lists instead of using adjacency
matrices, (*) Prim's algorithm can be run in O of E log V instead of O of V-squared. Fredman and Tarjan
developed a form of this data structure that inserts, decreases keys, and merges in amortized constant time;
that variant of this data structure is a collection of trees; that is the Fibonacci type. For 10 points, name this
data structure whose min type satisfies the property that the key of a child is always greater than or equal to
the key of a parent.
ANSWER: heap
In 1964, Robert W. Floyd developed an algorithm that converts a list into this type of data structure
in "big-O-of n" time by building them with from bottom up. One type of them performs unions in
constant time due to the fact that there is always a pointer to the minimum value and siblings are
organized in doubly-linked cyclic lists. One algorithm named for these objects improved the
efficiency of a sorting algorithm that was further improved by (*) smoothsort and runs in "big O of nlog-n" time. Priority queues often utilize the Fibonacci variety of these data structures when running
Dijkstra's algorithm. For 10 points, name this type of tree-based data structure in which children nodes have
lower key values than their parent's key value.
ANSWER: heaps [prompt on trees before read]
The most efficient implementation of Dijkstra is done using a Fibonacci one of these structures. Priority
queues are typically implemented using a binary of them. A n log n sorting algorithm that uses these data
structures adds elements to one, maintaining their namesake property, and then removes the elements while
again maintaining that property. For 15 points, identify this data structure similar to a tree except parent
nodes must either always be less than or always greater than their children.
ANSWER: heaps
Munro and Suwanda advocate using a bi-parental one in some cases, allowing for square root n
search times. Their "soft" variety introduces "corruptions" to increase operation speed. Crane
introduced one that uses an S-value and is unbalanced, the "leftist" type. Better amortized runtime
than allowed by binomial ones is achieved by lazy evaluation made possible in a specially defined
forest, their "Fibonacci" type. The namesake of an n log n-time sorting algorithm, it is implemented as a
tree for which all children are less in value than their parents. For 10 points, name this range of allocatable
memory named for its indeterminate shape and size.
ANSWER: heap [do not accept "tree" at any point; bi-parental trees do not make sense]
The Hopf-Rinow theorem can generalize this theorem to complete Riemann manifolds. Its first proof
utilized a Lebesgue chain, and one of its namesakes originally linked it to uniform continuity. Veblen noted
its logical equivalence to the statement that every cut on an ordered field F goes through some element, the
Dedekind Cut Axiom. The Weierstrauss property provides equivalence to this statement if every sequence
in the set has a convergent subsequence, though this is commonly stated as every cover having a finite
subcover when applied to metric spaces, where this theorem holds for completeness and total boundedness.
FTP, identify this doubly eponymous theorem which states that a subset of a Euclidean space is closed and
bounded if and only if it is compact.

The GNS construction validates the use of these spaces because it derives them as representations of
positive forms on a C-star algebra. Symmetric or antisymmetric tensor products of these spaces yield

According to the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, one form of this property for a set of numbers
implies another form of this property for the corresponding powers of e. In mathematical logic,
forcing is a technique which can be used to prove results regarding consistency and this property.
For a sequence of random variables, this property suffices, but is not necessary, to show that the sum
of their (*) variances is equal to the variance of their sum. In probability, two events have this property if
the probability of their intersection is equal to the product of their probabilities. The elements of a basis for
a vector space have this property. For 10 points, name this property, the linear form of which says no
element can be written as a linear combination of the others.
ANSWER: independence
If a set of solutions to a differential equation have this property, their Wronskian [RAHN-skee-un] is
nonzero. The smallest set of vectors that span a vector space and have this property is known as a basis; this
property for vectors implies that no nontrivial linear combination of them equals the zero vector. The rows
of a matrix must have this quality for the matrix to be invertible. If two random variables satisfy this
property, their correlation coefficient is zero, and if two events have this property, the probability of their
intersection is the product of their probabilities. Identify this property which in probability indicates that the
result of one event has no effect on the result of another.
ANSWER: (linear or statistical) independence [accept word forms of independent]
Coordinates of a random point on a high-dimensional sphere have approximately this property. If
the probabilities of events with this property sum to infinity, then infinitely many will occur,
according to the second Borel-Cantelli lemma. Bayesian networks extensively use its conditional
form. It is an assumption of the Central Limit Theorem and Law of Large Numbers, and for events X and
Y with this property, expectation distributes over multiplication. For ten points, identify this property whose
"linear" variety is possessed by a collection of vectors if none of them can be written as a linear
combination of the other.
ANSWER: Independence
If two random variables have this property, then their covariance is equal to zero as the expected value of
their product is equal to the product of their expected values. Any given element of the basis of a vector
space has this property with respect to any subset of the basis. That's because no basis is formed of vectors
that cannot be written as a linear combination of each other and are therefore linearly this. If two events, A
and B, are this, then the probability of both of them occurring is equal to the probability of A times the
probability of B. The effect of, for 10 points, what type of variable is traditionally measured in science
experiments?
ANSWER: independent [or word forms; do not accept or prompt on "dependent"]
In graph theory, this adjective is synonymous with stable and refers to a set of vertices that are not
connected to each other by any edges. In statistics, this adjective applies to variables that have a correlation
coefficient near zero. In probability, this adjective applies to events if the probability of both events
occurring is the product of the individual probabilities. Name this adjective that in algebra refers to a
variable that is input into a function.
ANSWER: independent or independence
By definition, A and B have this property if the probability of A given B is equal to the probability of A. If
the probability of A is nonzero, having this property precludes A and any other event with nonzero
probability being mutually exclusive. Rearrangement of the definition proves that if A and B have this
property, then the probability of A and B equals the probability of A times the probability of B. Name this
term that describes two events that have no influence on each other.
ANSWER: independence (or independent events)
This relationship is represented by a non-edge in a Bayesian net. The chi-squared distribution is a sum of
normal random variables in this relationship. When this condition holds, the covariance is equal to zero and
the variance is additive. The Gambler's Fallacy arises because the gambler does not realize that separate
trials satisfy this property. Events A and B have this property if the probability of A AND B is the product
of their individual probabilities. For ten points, identify this statistical relationship of two events that do not
inuence each other.

Peano's [pee-AH-no-z] last axiom defines this technique, whose transfinite type can be used to prove that
the axiom of choice implies Zorn's lemma. A famous incorrect application of it demonstrates that all horses
have the same color, and a version of it that relies on more assumptions is called the strong type. This
method can show that a given expression is always divisible by a given number, or it can verify the closed
formulas for summing arithmetic and geometric sequences. Name this method of mathematical proof that
proves a base case, then proves that if a statement is true for n, it must be true for n+1.
ANSWER: proof by induction [or inductive proof]
This technique's strong form allows for the formula in question to work for not only for some n equal to k,
but n less than k. This tool works by first proving a base case, then showing that if a formula works for
some number n, then it works for "n+1." It is very similar to recursion. This mathematical proof technique
shares its name with a type of logic moving from cases to a general conclusion. For 10 points, name this
proof technique that also labels a type of reasoning that is not deductive.
ANSWER: induction or inductive
Properties of well-ordered sets, such as point-set topologies, are often demonstrated using the
transfinite form of this technique. George Polya used the example of a horse of a different color to
illustrate the subtleties of this technique. The strong form of this technique allows one to assume that
a statement is true for all values in between zero and k. This technique, which is closely related to
recursion, begins by proving a (*) base case and then assuming the namesake hypothesis is true for n;
subsequently, one must demonstrate that a statement holds for the n + 1 case. For 10 points, name this kind
of mathematical proof in which some statement is demonstrated to be true for all natural numbers.

Exponentiations of the function one plus x can be approximated by the Bernoulli one of these entities, while
another one governs inner products and is named for Cauchy (koh-SHEE) and Schwarz. Any two numbers
must satisfy one of three properties, two of which are of this type, according to the trichotomy property, and
these types of relations are antisymmetric. The arithmetic-geometric one of these concerns the means of

relationships.
ANSWER: inequality or inequalities
One of these which holds for random variables that attain only positive values is named for Markov, while a
more general one is named for Bienayme. Another one of these can be proven by taking the sum of the
quantity p sub j times q sub k minus p sub k times q sub j, quantity squared, and then taking advantage of
the fact that the sum must not be negative. That example is named for Bunyakovsky in Russia but in most
places is known as the Cauchy-Schwarz [koh-shee shvarts] one. The Minkowski one of these statements
generalizes the "triangle" one, which relates the length of one side to the sum of the lengths of the other
two. The solutions to these in a single variable can be expressed by shading a number line, and
multiplication by a negative number causes one of these to be "reversed." Name these mathematical
relations which can be expressed using the operators less than or greater than.

The first fundamental form of a surface is essentially an instance of it performed on two elements of
the tangent space. The Bogoliubov type of this operation takes operators as arguments, and in a
Minkowski space this operation is non-degenerate rather than positive definite. Over a complex
Hilbert space, this object is necessarily a Hermitian form, and a Hilbert space is a complete abstract

Square matrices for which this operation is defined have linearly independent columns. A statement with
this kind of relationship to a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the converse and can be stated

For a matrix, this entity is equal to one over its determinant times the adjugate of the matrix. A
matrix does not have one of these if its determinant is zero. The line y = x is a line of symmetry for
the graphs of two functions that have this property. Differentiation and (*) integration share this
property, as do exponential and logarithmic functions. For any real number a, 1 over a is its multiplicative
one. For 10 points, give this term that applies to operations that "undo" one another.
ANSWER: inverse
Matrices that are not square may have retractions and sections without having one of these, and a square
matrix doesn't have one if its determinant is zero; in other words, if it is degenerate or singular. The
trigonometric functions are made to have one by introducing domain restrictions, though notational
difficulties arise due to the traditional use of superscripts. The identity function has one, since it easily
passes the horizontal line test. For 10 points, give the term that indicates that a function's action undoes the

An n-dimensional manifold has this property if any embedded sphere of dimension n minus 1 bounds
a ball of dimension n. Any representation of a finite Lie algebra can be decomposed into a direct sum
of representations with this property. A topological space has this property if and only if its not the
union of two proper subsets, and one way of showing that a ring has this property is to show that its

its version 1.1; however, built-in garbage collection continues to make this language slower than its
predecessors. This language was once called Oak, and was marketed with the slogan "write once, run
anywhere", touting the portability it sees from running its programs in a namesake virtual machine in the
form of bytecode. A rival to C++, for ten points, name this object-oriented programming language
developed by Sun Microsystems.
ANSWER: Java (do not prompt on or accept "Javascript")
This language recently introduced autoboxing. GUIs (GOO-ees) can be created in this language by AWT
("A-W-T") and Swing. Its string class is immutable, but its stringbuffer class is mutable. Common
exceptions in this language are IndexOutOfBoundsException, NullPointerException, and
RuntimeException. It runs on a namesake virtual machine. For 10 points, name this object oriented Sun
Microsystems created programming language.
ANSWER: Java
This programming language differs from its predecessors in that it doesn-t require different software
for each individual processor; this is a result of the fact that it converts written code into bytecode,
which led to the slogan "write once, run anywhere." This bytecode can be run on any machine that
has its namesake (*) virtual machine. Though it is a higher level language that supports object-oriented
programming techniques, it doesn-t support pointer arithmetic, differentiating it from C++ (C-plus-plus).

applets.
ANSWER: Java [do not accept JavaScript, it is unrelated]
Since 2001, Windows has shipped without this programming language preinstalled as a result of
Microsoft's alleged modified implementation of it. This language lacks pointers, and it does not support
multiple inheritance for classes. A compressed folder containing files written in this language has the
extension .jar ("dot-jar"), and Oracle released JDK to allow for development in this language. This
language's namesake bytecode is executed by its virtual machine, and this language's namesake applets may
be run within web browsers. For 10 points, name this object-oriented language developed by James Gosling
at Sun Microsystems, whose logo is a coffee mug.

Doc comments for this language can be produced by including comments started by a forward slash
followed by two asterisks and ended by an asterisk followed by a forward slash. Checked exceptions
were first devised for this language. Almost all code in this language must be located inside a class.
IDEs written in, and primarily for, it include Eclipse and NetBeans. It is touted as (*) "write once, run
anywhere." Source code in this language is compiled into bytecode which runs on a namesake virtual
machine. For 10 points, name this language originally designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems.
ANSWER: Java [do not accept "JavaScript"]
This language does not support operator overloading or multiple inheritance for classes, which helps to
prevent potential errors and anti-pattern design. Because this language does not support pointer arithmetic,
its garbage collector is allowed to relocate referenced objects. Widget toolkits are typically used to
implement applets in this language, and this programming language's motto is "write once, run anywhere."
This language's namesake bytecodes can be executed by its namesake virtual machine. For 10 points, name
this programming language developed by Sun Microsystems.

Project Lambda is an initiative to add closures to this programming language. Fragments were recently
introduced in one use of this programming language in which Intents are used to interact with other apps.
The graphical user interface for it is provided by the Swing library, and its just in time compiler compiles its
bytecode. Used to write Android applications, this object oriented language uses ArrayLists, and programs
in it often include the phrase "public static void main." Applets written in this language are often found on
web pages. For 10 points, name this programming language named for an Indonesian island whose logo is a
cup of coffee.
ANSWER: Java [Do not accept "JavaScript."]
Compilers of this language translate programs into bytecode, rather than machine language, which is
then run by a namesake Virtual Machine. Unlike C and C++, this language does not support pointer
arithmetic, though like those languages, it has primitive data types that are not objects. Widget toolkits like
the Abstract Window Toolkit and Swing are commonly used to implement applets in this language. Initially
called Oak, for 10 points, name this language, which is not actually related to a similarly named "Script."
ANSWER: Java
In development, this language was known as Oak. This language, which does not use pointer arithmetic
despite sharing much of its syntax with C++ ["C plus plus"], is able to run on multiple platforms because of
its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" design, where it runs on a Virtual Machine. Originally licensed by Sun
Microsystems and now by Oracle, for 10 points, name this object-oriented programming language,
developed by James Gosling, which shares its name with an island in Indonesia and is not related to a
similarly-named "Script."

and states that any two composition series in a group are isomorphic. Any matrix with coefficients from an
algebraically closed field can be rewritten in terms of blocks containing a single eigenvalue on the main
diagonal and ones on the superdiagonal, a block form name after this man. Another result of his states that
any closed curve divides the plane into an inside and an outside. For 10 points, identify this French
mathematician, namesake of a "normal" or "canonical" form of a matrix, as well as a curve theorem.

He defended his doctoral dissertation on "Tschirnhaus transformations: algebraic equations with one
unknown" under the supervision of Franz Meyer. This physicist's most important contribution was
partially anticipated by the work of Nordstrom and Larmor, who both used the flat (*) Minkowski

from which the electromagnetic and gravitational fields arise, with a cylindrical condition or "fifth world
dimension." For 10 points, name this German mathematician, whose work was modified by Klein and forms
the basis of modern string theory.
ANSWER: Theodore Kaluza
In machine learning, this term describes a set of methods that allow operation in high-dimensional implicit
feature spaces by replacing inner products with other functions that satisfy Mercer's inequality. One
example of a set of such functions is the "radial basis function" one of these, which is used in SVM. In
mathematics, for an integral transform of a function f, this is a 2D-function that multiplies f inside the
integral. For a group homomorphism, the first isomorphism theorem guarantees that an object described by
this term is a subgroup of the domain group G. For linear maps, the set described by this term is equivalent
to the null space, and is a subspace of the domain whose elements all map to zero in the image. For 10
points, name this term also describing the central program of an operating system.

These things are divided into monolithic and micro types, the latter of which is exemplified by the
as-yet-unfinished GNU Hurd (NEW HERD). Programs request service from these things by executing a
system call. A BSD-based example of these things was originally used in OS X. The Tanenbaum-Torvalds
debate concerned the implementation of a type of these things for Linux. Identify this component of an
operating system that serves as an interface between hardware and software applications.

This mathematician derived methods for solving cubic equations as well as some of higher orders. He
wrote about binomial coefficients in Pascal's triangle and wrote "On the Difficulties of Euclid's
Definitions". This man advanced Euclid's parallel postulate and contributed to the eventual
development of (*) non-Euclidean geometry. His approach to higher degree polynomials was through
geometric algebra and his solutions are not numerical but are line segments instead. For ten points, name

ANSWER: Omar Khayyam
John Conway has suggested the word "strombus" derived from the Greek word for a spinning top for this
type of polygon. These shapes have a single reflective symmetry across one of their diagonals, and concave
shapes with similar definitions are sometimes called darts or arrowheads. Not generally parallelograms,
their area can be computed by taking one half the product of the diagonals, which are perpendicular to each
other though only one is necessarily a bisector. Give the name of this type of quadrilateral that has two pairs
of congruent adjacent sides.
ANSWER: kites
This is the most general quadrilateral for which exactly one pair of opposite vertices are equidistant
from any fixed point on the diagonal that does not go through them. Like rhombuses and squares,
these quadrilaterals have inscribed circles and perpendicular diagonals. When these quadrilaterals are
not convex, they can be called darts or arrowheads. One of this shape's diagonals is the perpendicular
bisector of the other, which is useful when proving that these shapes have one pair of congruent
angles. Name these shapes, also called deltoids, that have two pairs of congruent adjacent sides.
ANSWER: kites [prompt on deltoids]
This man's namesake algebra is a generalized boolean algebra that consists of a bounded distributive
lattice with an involution, and his name is sometimes given to the hierarchy of sets that is based on
the complexity of operations that define them. Another result named for him states that for any
recursive operator there exists a partial computable function such that the function of the operator
returns the operator, known as his namesake recursion theorem. A function that combines with and
negates itself is the subject of another statement of this man, which shows that the original lambda
calculus is inconsistent; that's a paradox named for him and Rosser. For 10 points, name this computer
scientist who invented regular expressions, which use a namesake operation star to define all possible
strings of a character set, known as his "star".

He is the namesake of the Hurwitz surface of the lowest possible genus, a compact Riemann surface
of genus three and order 168, known as his eponymous quartic. This author of the influential
classification scheme set forth in the Erlangen Program is the namesake of a (*) disc model of the
hyperbolic plane in which a line is defined as a chord. His namesake group has four elements and is the

168 orientation-preserving automorphisms exist for this man's namesake Riemann surface
quartic. This man proposed classifying geometries according to group theory and projective
geometry in his 1872 manifesto, the Erlangen program. While at Gottingen, this man served as a
doctoral adviser to Grace Chisholm Young, the first female mathematics Ph.D. recipient there.
An immersion of another object named for this man resembles a twisted figure 8. That object
only requires six colors for map coloring, making it the sole exception to the Heawood

Mobius strip. For 10 points, name this German mathematician who devised a namesake bottle.
ANSWER: Felix Klein [or Christian Felix Klein]
Two distinct ones of these cannot have the same exterior by the Gordon-Luecke theorem. Dowker
notation can describe their projection. Twist, poke, and slide make up the Reidemeister moves on diagrams
of these. They can be described by Jones and Alexander polynomials, which can be generalized to the
HOMFLY polynomial. A simple loop is known as the un- one of these; a simple, non-trivial one is the
trefoil. Slightly more general structures permitting open ends are known as braids. For 10 points, name
these closed non-intersecting curves that cannot be untangled.
ANSWER: knots
This computer scientist created Metafont to produce vector fonts, but it never caught on with font designers,
perhaps due to its sixty parameters. His MMIX is a fictional 64 bit RISC architecture that will replace the
MIX architecture, unusual for running in either binary or decimal, as the implementor chooses, and for
having bytes of either six binary bits or two decimal digits in the fourth edition of his most famous work,
which is currently unfinished, and includes a volume on "Fundamental Algorithms" and fascicles on
combinatorial algorithms. Version numbers for Metafont and this man's more famous program approach e

His first scientific article was published in MAD Magazine, and he has used the royalties from one of his
works to install a pipe organ in his home. The version numbers of programs he has written asymptotically
approach transcendental numbers, and until recently he famously awarded one hexadecimal dollar to anyone
who discovered an error in his books. For ten points, name this computer scientist, creator of the TeX
typesetting system and the unfinished seven-volume work The Art of Computer Programming.
ANSWER: Donald Ervin Knuth
This person is the primary discoverer of an algorithm that orients input identities, completes the
resulting rules, detects critical pairs, obtains their normal forms, and adds a new rule for every
normal pair per the reduction order; that algorithm yields confluent term re-writing systems. This
scientist is the major author of a linear-time algorithm that compares a subject string to the
beginning of an object string, then repeatedly jumps the former ahead by the distance to the first

TeX. This person developed a system for notating large numbers using uparrows. Name this Stanford
professor who authored The Art of Computer Programming.
ANSWER: Donald Knuth
For this algorithm to be implemented efficiently, a fast union-find data structure is required, because
it allows for the determination of connectivity. The complexity of the standard form of this algorithm
can be reduced from O(E logE) to the mathematically equivalent O(E logV) by using properties of
the logarithm. Upon initialization, this algorithm creates a (*) forest of size V and then utilizes the cut
property by sorting all edges of the graph and then checking for cycles with the lowest-weight, unused edge.
This algorithm differs from another that accomplishes a similar task because this algorithm works for
disconnected graphs. For 10 points, name this greedy algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a
graph, which is more generalized than Prim's algorithm.
ANSWER: Kruskal's algorithm [prompt on "minimum spanning tree finding algorithm" until "minimum spanning tree" is mentioned]
One modification to this algorithm improves on its running time by replacing its primary data
structure with a number of leftist binary trees, which can be easily merged; that modification is the
Cheriton-Tarjan algorithm. The amortized run-time of one subsection of this algorithm is a notable
instance of the inverse Ackermann function appearing in time complexity. The optimizations of
"union by rank" and "path compression" can be used to improve on a subsection of this algorithm
known as the union-find algorithm. This algorithm has running time "Big O of (*) E log E" where E
is the number of edges, since the dominating step in this algorithm is sorting the edges by weight. It works
by iteratively choosing the lowest weight edge that connects two previously unconnected components in the
graph. For 10 points, name this graph algorithm that, like Boruvka's algorithm and Prim's algorithm, finds
the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
ANSWER: Kruskal's Algorithm
It has a discrete analog in the Stolz-Cesaro theorem, which holds that the limit of the ratio of the difference
between consecutive terms of two sequences is equal to the limit of the ratio of the terms. It is usually
proved using the extended mean value theorem, and this statement holds only when one of the functions it
describes does not change from positive to negative infinitely many times. It fails on the limit of x divided
by the square root of x-squared plus one as x goes to infinity. FTP, identify this method that uses derivatives
to compute indeterminate limits.
ANSWER: L-Hopital's rule (or Bernoulli's rule)
It does not hold where "g prime x" changes sign repeatedly as it approaches infinity, and can
sometimes cause problems in cases like the one where f of x equals the quantity x plus cosine of x
times sine x, and g of x equals e to the sine x power times the quantity x plus cosine x times sine x. In
other circumstances, it causes repeated oscillations, which make it impossible to find the limit. For
ten points, name this rule, discovered by Bernoulli and named for the author of the textbook in which it
first appears, which states that the limit of f of x divided by g of x as both approach infinity equals the limit
of f prime x divided by g prime x.
ANSWER: L-Hopital's rule (accept L-Hospital's rule or Bernoulli's rule before his name is mentioned)
Lawlor developed a multivariate version of this statement that applies to functions on a smooth
curve. This theorem is proven by invoking Cauchy's mean value theorem to show that one quantity
involved is bounded by two functions. This theorem can be applied to the expression x to the power
of x by using a logarithm. This theorem cannot be applied when ratios of certain trigonometric
functions are involved due to repeated (*) oscillations, and it is able to transform indeterminate forms to
determinate ones. This theorem states that f x over g x has the same limit as f prime x over g prime x. For
10 points, name this theorem which is used to find the limit when a expression like zero divided by zero is
involved.
ANSWER: L'Hopital's Rule
This man names a result stating that the order of every subgroup of a group must divide the order of that

stationary relative to two larger bodies.
ANSWER: Joseph Louis Lagrange
This man improved upon Brouncker's continued fractions method to obtain a generalized solution of
Pell's equations. His theorem in abstract algebra says a subgroup's order must divide the group's
order, and he proved that each positive integer can be expressed as a sum of four squares. His work on
the 3-question problem led to his namesake points, where the gravitational attraction of two bodies is balanced.
For 10 points, name this French mathematician who lends his name to method of optimization which uses a
name namesake multiplier and is useful when geometric constraints are present.
ANSWER: Joseph Louis Lagrange
This man's "resolvent" is used to solve cubic equations, and his "spectrum," which ends at Freiman's
constant, consists of his "numbers." One theory named for him states that if p is a prime number and f a
polynomial of degree n, then the equation f of x = 0 mod p has at most n solutions between 0 and p. Another
namesake theorem states that the size of a subgroup must divide that of any group containing it. The
maximum and minimum values of a function subject to a geometric constraint can be found with his
multipliers. For 10 points, identify this man who found the five spots in a two question system where a third
question of negligible mass will be stationary, known as his "points."
ANSWER: Joseph-Louis Lagrange
An identity named for this man can be obtained by using only two, rather than four sets of elements in the
Cauchy-Binet identity and gives a more general form of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. This man also
names the remainder obtained in the Taylor series for a function. In physics, his namesake operator is equal
to kinetic energy minus potential energy, laying down his theory of mechanics. Locations in an orbital
system where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance are five points named for this man. For 10 points,
name this mathematician whose namesake multipliers are used to maximize a function subject to
constraints.
ANSWER: Joseph-Louis Lagrange
He showed that, for a squarefree integer n in the equation x-squared minus n y-squared equals one
that there are infinitely many x and y. In addition to creating continued fractions to solve Pell's
equation, he also published the first proof of Wilson's theorem. He proved that, for any subgroup of
a finite group, the order of the (*) subgroup divides the original group, and also created a technique for
performing constrained maximization that uses his multipliers. For 10 points, name this French
mathematician whose five points in an orbital system are the positions where a question affected only by
gravity can remain stationary.

De Bruijn invented an alternative syntax for use in this system, and Sinot created director strings in order to
find the complexity cost of beta reduction in this system. Rosser and one formulator of this system found a
paradox proving the untyped version of this system to be inconsistent as a basis for logic, while Rosser and
the other creator of this system showed that this system possesses confluence. The funarg problem can arise
when implementing this system in stack-based languages, since such an implementation requires treating
functions as first-class objects. Containing "abstractions" and "applications," this system was shown to be
Turing-complete. Implemented in functional programming languages such as Haskell and Lisp, for 10
points, name this formal system for representing functions, developed by Stephen Kleene and Alonzo
Church and named for a Greek symbol.
ANSWER: lambda calculus
Two expressions in system are alpha-equivalent if they can be made literally the same by changing bound
variables. The startup incubator Y Combinator is named after the fixed point operator in this language, used
to create recursion. Since terms in the language consist entirely of variables and functions, numbers are
implemented as "numerals" named after the language's inventor. Its inventor used the undecidability of
equivalence in this Turing-complete model of computation to give a negative answer to Hilbert's
Entscheidungsproblem in 1936, soon after Turing's own answer based on the Halting Problem. For 10

but it does not possess the power of computational universality that this possesses. Its relation to
deductive logic was shown to be equivalence via the Curry-Howard isomorphism. This system, which
was designed to minimally model (*) function creation and function application, is often used to model
functional programming languages. Alpha reductions and Beta reductions are used to show the equivalence
of statements in this system. For 10 points name this mathematical model developed by Alonzo Church,

It generalizes to the d-Alembertian in Minkowski space-time, and the objective of the Dirichlet problem is
to find a function with given boundary data that vanishes under it. This operator acts by a negative scalar on
a solution to the Helmholtz equation, and it yields the charge density when applied to the electric potential
according to Poisson's equation. The harmonic functions form its kernel, while for a particle in space, the
kinetic energy is given by a scalar multiple of its application to the wavefunction. For 10 points, identify
this operator which is equal to the divergence of the gradient and which is commonly denoted by a single
capital delta.
ANSWER: Laplacian [or Laplace operator]
It is equivalent to the trace of the Hessian matrix of a function and in Minkowski spacetime and the
d'Alembertian operator is an application of it. It can also be applied, component-wise, to vector fields, in
which case in three dimensions it is equal to the gradient of the divergence minus the curl of the curl. The
problem of finding an unknown function from the result of this operator applied to the function is known as
Poisson's equation. This linear second-order differential operator also appears in electrostatics where it
relates the potential to the charge density. Functions for which this is zero everywhere are called harmonic
functions and have no local extrema, and their average value over a spherical surface is equal to their value
at the center of that sphere. For 10 points, name this scalar operator equal to the divergence of the gradient.
ANSWER: Laplace operator or Laplacian
Markov's inequality can be used with Chebyshev's inequality to derive one form of this law, a form that
also leads to the asymptotic equipartition property. The other form of this theorem applies if the sum of all
variances divided by the index squared converges; that is known as the Kolmogorov criterion, and applies
to the strong version of this theorem, which adds that the convergence is almost sure. With a name coined
by Simeon Poisson, identify this law that states that as n approaches infinity, the arithmetic mean of n
random variables converges to its expected value.
ANSWER: law of large numbers [accept "weak" or "strong" as a modifier; accept Bernoulli's Theorem]
The "column address strobe" type of this phenomenon affects RAM. This quantity is fixed in a cut-through
switch, although it's variable in store and forward switches. Little's Law relates it to arrival rate and queue
length, and applications that seek to improve this quantity while reducing reliability often use the UDP
protocol. One common adage among computer designers says that "cycles are cheap, bandwidth is
expensive" but that this quantity "is physics", as the speed of light often provides a fundamental limit to it.
The round trip type of this phenomenon can be measured with the ping tool, and this quantity is often
compared to the length of a pipe, as opposed to the length of a pipe which represents bandwidth. For 10
points, name this delay between requesting something and receiving it.

These constructs are used in statistical sampling to randomly cover an area with a fixed set of elements.
Gaston Terry's proof by exhaustion that there is no solution to the 36 officer problem proved that a more

A method developed by Bochner generalizes this operation to Banach spaces, while a similar but
weaker generalization was developed by Gelfand and Pettis using duality. The Henstock-Kurzweil
operation reduces to this operation for bounded functions, while for a sequence of non-negative
functions this operation can be bounded using a limit inferior according to Fatou's lemma, and this
operation also obeys the dominated convergence and unlike the operation it generalizes, it obeys the
monotone convergence condition and doesn-t distinguish functions that are identical almost everywhere.

The Diophantine equation given by ax^2 + by^2 + cz^2 = 0 is named for this mathematician who
conjectured that there is a prime number between n^2 and (n+1)^2 for every integer n and proved
that pi squared is irrational. The Dirichlet ["dee-ree-klay"] character generalizes this man's
"symbol," which for an integer a and a prime p returns either 1, -1, or 0, depending on whether or
not a is a quadratic residue mod p. His transformation, which is generalized by convex conjugation
and is denoted (*) f-star, satisfies the functional equation "f-star of f-prime of x equals x times f-prime of x
minus f of x." His namesake differential equation is encountered when solving the Laplace equation in

One invention of this man was an early mechanical calculator capable of performing all four arithmetical
operations, the Staffelwalze. In contrast to most contemporary theories, he posited that space, time, and
motion are relative. Early on in his career, he invented the binary number system, and his greatest
contribution to metaphysics was his theory of monads. However, he is best known for an enduring dispute
with Isaac Newton. FTP, name this German polymath, who invented calculus.
ANSWER: Gottfried Leibniz
He held the conviction that space was relative rather than absolute, a prediction that would prove prescient
when Albert Einstein advanced the same view. Abraham Robinson would later vindicate his most famous
accomplishment, using the standard part function. Similarly, his identity of indiscernibles is considered to
have anticipated quantum mechanics, and he invented the modern system of binary arithmetic. For 10

This shape is the cissoid of a single circle using a point located root two times the radius from the center,
and it is the inversion of a hyperbola. This shape also is the envelope of circles centered on a hyperbola and
passing through the center of that hyperbola, and it also is the locus of points such that the product of the
distances to two fixed points is constant. A specific case of a Cassini oval, this shape can be expressed in

Starting with a circle and fixed point P, this curve is the locus of all points X so that PX is perpendicular to
a tangent line of the circle, which means that this is the pedal [PEED-ul] curve of a circle. Similar to a

ANSWER: limacon
This term can be used as an adjective to describe a set that represents the state of a dynamical system after
an infinite amount of time or to describe a point that can also be called an accumulation point. This term
also is applied to values whose existence can be proven using the squeeze theorem or a method referred to
as delta-epsilon. These values are often evaluated by taking the derivatives of both the numerator and
denominator of a rational function, a method known as l-Hopital's rule. These values are equal to the values
of continuous functions, and they are commonly used to find derivatives. Give this value that the output of a
function may approach when the input approaches a specified value.
ANSWER: limit
The test named for this concept can be used to show that a series diverges, but it can only show
convergence for alternating series. Evaluating derivatives of the numerator and denominator of
a rational function separately can be used in some cases to evaluate this value using L-Hopital's
rule. This concept may be formally defined using delta-epsilon proofs, and this concept applied to a
difference quotient is the definition of the derivative. The left and right values of this must equal
both each other and the value of a function for a function to be continuous. Name this value that a
function approaches.
ANSWER: limits
This operation is applied after setting up a ratio or root operation in a test for convergence. If a function
f is bounded by two functions g and h with a value L for this operation, then this operation on f also yields
L according to the squeeze theorem. Indeterminate forms in this operation can be simplified by taking
derivatives using L'Hopital's Rule. A right arrow is used to denote the approach to one of these. For 10

A double pointwise type of this operation is used to construct the indicator function of the
rationals. One method of evaluating this operation is to find a pair of functions that bound the input
and use the Squeeze Theorem. Proving that the result of this operation exists is done using the
epsilon-delta method. Solving improper integrals requires taking this operation on one of the bounds.
When substitution yields indeterminate forms, this operation is solved using (*) L'Hopital's Rule. The
result of this operation exists if and only if its left and right versions are equal, and this operation taken on h
is used to define the derivative. For 10 points, name this operation that gives the value of a function as the
input approaches a given value.

In complete metric spaces, Cauchy sequences always have one of these. Those of a function can be
found using the sandwich theorem and a typical definition is that for some delta region around x, f(x) will
be within some epsilon region. A technique for finding indeterminate ones of functions of form f(x)/g(x) c
uses the ratio of the respective derivatives and is better known as L-Hopital's rule. These are often used to
give define derivatives. For 10 points, name this concept often given as the value of a function as it
approaches a certain point.
ANSWER: limit
Statements involving this concept are formally proven using delta-epsilon proofs. The squeeze theorem
is used to find unknown ones based on ones already known. In statistics, a theorem named for the central
one of these states how variables approach the normal distribution. L'Hopital's (LOW-pea-tal's) rule is used
to find it for indeterminate forms. Functions that have a value for it are called convergent. For 10 points,
name this concept from calculus that is defined as a fixed value that a function gets infinitely close to.

ANSWER: limit
In a topological space, this operator on a net is equivalent to x if, for every neighborhood U of x, the net is
eventually in U. When "sup" is appended to its name, it defines the least upper bound of a sequence, and
points of this name are closely related to cluster points for sequences. A derivative is commonly defined by
this function as the denominator of a certain fraction goes to zero, and this function can be solved for
indeterminate fractions via L-Hopital's rule. For 10 points, identify this mathematical construct defined for
convergent sequences, which exists at a point if its one-sided values are equivalent to its overall value, often
symbolized L.
ANSWER: limits
One explanation of this developed by Bolzano includes using two Greek letters to define an error and a
distance. Known as the epsilon-delta definition of this function, L'Hopital's Rule gives a way to evaluate
this function using derivatives for certain expressions. Often used to evaluate functions from the right or
left side of an input, for 10 points, name this function that provides a value for an equation as it approaches
a particular point.
ANSWER: limit function
This word describes all the points found in the closure of a set, including accumulation points. The
"superior" and "inferior" forms of this operation are equal only for convergent sequences. The definition of
"big-O" notation in asymptotic analysis uses one form of this operation. Weierstrass developed the first
formal method of evaluating this operation, using "epsilons" and "deltas". When dealing with indeterminate
forms, l'Hopital's rule is used to evaluate this operation. Applying this operation to difference quotients is a
common way to define derivatives. For 10 points, name this operation that yields the value a function
approaches as its input approaches a given value.

In conic sections, one of these curves is used when defining the directrix. The degenerate case of the
hyperbola is two of these curves intersecting and this curve is formed by intersecting two planes. When
bounded by two endpoints they are known as segments and they can be written in point slope form or slope
intercept form. For 10 points, name this type of curve which on the Cartesian plane can be written with the

Euler's [OY-ler-s] method uses these figures to approximate solutions to differential equations, and
Newton's method approximates graphs as these figures to find roots. One of these figures is generated by
the polar graph of the secant function. For any two points there is exactly one of these that goes through
them, and these figures can be generated by extending a segment forever in both directions. Name these
figures whose graph equations can be put into slope-intercept form.
ANSWER: line (prompt on "segment" or "ray" until the end of the 2nd sentence; segment or ray is incorrect after that)
Inverting a circle that contains the center of inversion will produce one of these shapes. If a set of
points is in the "general position", then none of these shapes contain three of them. Newton's Method

with the x-axis. They are the union of two antiparallel (*) rays that share an endpoint. For 10 points,
identify these one-dimensional shapes whose equations can be written as y = ax + b.
ANSWER: lines
The Radon transform takes two parameters: a function and one of these. The Runge-Kutta method
approximates the solutions to differential equations by considering them to behave like these in short
intervals, as does Euler's method. This is the shape of the graph of r equals the cosecant of theta. In 3space, these can be expressed using symmetric equations and are formed by the intersection of two
nonparallel planes. Three points that do not lie on one of these define a plane in 3-space, and any two
distinct points define one of them. Point-slope and slope-intercept forms express what mathematical objects,
as does the graph of a function of the form y equals m x plus b?
ANSWER: lines [or linear functions; accept tangent lines after "Runge-Kutta", accept horizontal lines after "r equals"]
The Sylvester-Gallai theorem gives a requirement that all items in question are upon only one of these.

One early method for this procedure was Fourier-Motzkin elimination, and the Hirsch conjecture provides
an upper bound on the runtime of one method. Another method involves introducing slack variables and
then manipulating the tableau through repeated pivoting. Karmarkar's algorithm and other interior point
methods are among the fastest solutions, and the ellipsoid algorithm was the first polynomial time algorithm
for it. The cutting-plane method can be used to solve the integer variety, which is NP-hard but which can
sometimes be approximated by examining the dual. Originally developed by Kantorovich to optimize
plywood production, FTP, name this problem, efficiently solved using the simplex method, which calls for
the optimization of a linear objective function given linear constraints.

A method developed by George Dantzig to solve these types of problems uses slack variables and pivot
operations within a canonical tableau and is known as the simplex algorithm. When these problems involve
only two independent variables, they can be visualized by determining which lines with given slopes have

this technique to solve optimization problems of the namesake form.
ANSWER: linear programming [prompt on partial answers]
One method of solving this problem is improved by using Bland's rule, and a polynomial-time
method of solving this problem is the ellipsoid algorithm. Interior-point algorithms, like
Karmarkar's, are another method of solving these problems. The fundamental theorem of solving
these problems states that there either exists a finite solution, or the problem is either infeasible or
unbounded. A popular method used to solve this kind of problem introduces slack variables in order to

These data structures can be improved with the move-to-front heuristic. One can reduce the typical
two fields needed in one variety of these to only one using a namesake "XOR" variation. In LISP,
these data structures are constructed from cons cells that contain the car and cdr fields. Many of
these layered on top of each other is known as a (*) skip. Each node in one of these data structures
contains a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node in a "double" version. For 10 points,
name these data structures that consist of nodes connected in a sequential order.
ANSWER: linked lists
Sequences of this data structure are used in a data structure created by William Pugh. This data
structure was first developed by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw and Herbert Simon for use in IPL. This is
one of the simplest data structures one can build out of conses in Lisp. A dummy object used to
simplify boundary conditions in these data structures is called a sentinel. Their "unrolled" type uses the
cache to increase performance by storing just enough elements in each section to fill a cache line. Their
last element is usually null, but it can reference their first element to form a "circular" one of these data
structures. They are often used to implement stacks and queues. These dynamically allocated data
structures also come in a "doubly" variety. For 10 points, identify this data structure constructed of
nodes with a data field and a pointer to the next node.
ANSWER: linked list
Tsakalidis represented these data structures as a BB-alpha tree, which allows one to find the ancestor
relationship of elements in Big O of 1 time. Maurer's Shadow Algorithm uses a dynamic version of
one of these data structures to speed up simulations. CDR coding is a representation for these them in
LISP, and multiple pieces of information are stored in each element in the (*) unrolled variant of them.
Their ends may be demarcated by sentinel nodes, while circular ones have the final node point to the initial
one. For 10 points, name these data structures which come in "singly" and "doubly" versions, whose nodes
each contains a pointer to the next and/or previous node.
ANSWER: linked lists
These are the basic data structure in Lisp, and in many functional languages, are implemented via cons
cells, each with a head and tail. They do not support efficient indexing, but do have faster insertion and
deletion than arrays, and need not be contiguous in memory. These structures can be classified as "single-"
or "doubly-", and they also can be classified as "linearly" or "circularly". Name this type of data structure in
which each node contains two fields, one containing the value and the other containing the location of the
next value.
ANSWER: linked lists [do not accept partial answers]
CDR and B trees function similarly to one variety of these structures, which can store references
while increasing cache performance. These structures are well suited to solving the Joesphus
problem, because they can delete nodes in sequence in Big O of 1, and they sometimes they contain
sentinel nodes to avoid special case code. They respond well to both insertion sort and merge sort,
and the move-to-front heuristic compensates for slow search through these even when sorted,
because random access takes Big O of n time. They can change in size dynamically and in addition to
circular, they can come in single and double varieties. For 10 points, name these data structures where
every node contains a pointer to the next node.
ANSWER: Linked Lists
A graph can be represented by storing the adjacencies of each vertex in one of these data structures. A
skip is made from layers consisting of this data structure. The last element of these data structures is usually
NULL, but can be changed to reference their first element to form a "circular" one. They're not trees, but
operations on these structures can be made easier by adding sentinel nodes. They are often used to
implement stacks and queues. Name this data structure whose "doubly" form consists of nodes with
pointers to their next node and previous node.
ANSWER: linked list [prompt on list]
The root of a Fibonacci heap is one of these structures. The most common method of chaining to
resolve collisions in hash tables utilizes this structure. Heapsort is generally avoided for sorting this
structure due to its poor performance with it. This structure is notorious for its poor cache
performance due to low locality of reference. The performance of algorithms working on these
structures can be increased if, instead of terminating them with NULL, they are terminated with a
dummy sentinel. When its consecutive nodes reference each other, it is described as "doubly". For 10
points, identify this data structure that contains a node with data and a pointer to the next node.
ANSWER: linked lists
The CAR and CDR operators work on this data structure. It's not a tree, but this structure may include
sentinel nodes. It can be used to implement a stack efficiently since inserting and removing the first
element takes constant time. In the worst case it will take Big-O of n time to insert and remove elements
from an n-element instance of this data structure. For 10 points name this type of list which in which each
data entry is associated with a pointer to the next item in the list.
ANSWER: linked list [prompt on list; or free list before "circular" is read]
Problematic instances of these data structures are found with algorithms named for Floyd and Brent. Several
of these data structures are combined in a probabilistic data structure comparable to balanced trees. These
data structures can be indexed in big O of n time. CAR and CDR are used for these structures in LISP, and
stacks and queues are most often implemented using them. Sentinel nodes are used in implementations of
these structures to make the last element point to something other than null. For 10 points, name these data
structures, a type of list where each node contains a pointer to the next one.

One use of this theorem is to show that a function can be represented as the sum of constants divided by its
poles. More notably, it can be used to show the contradiction that one divided by a function with no roots
must be both a function on the entire plane and be bounded. In this way, this theorem shows that every
function must have a number x0 such that f(x0) is equal to 0, the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. It can
be strengthened such that its conclusion is true for functions not mapped to only three points on the plane,
although the statement of it means that it only applies to functions that are holomorphic over the whole
complex plane. For ten points name this theorem of complex analysis, which states that a function that is
entire and bounded is constant.

In information theory, the self-information is defined as a function of this type applied to the reciprocal of
probability. On the complex plane, these functions, like the square root, require a branch cut along the

The complex version of this mathematical function is multi-valued every two pi i and hence

are usually executed several times until a condition is met.
ANSWER: loops [or repitition; or iteration]
In C++, the "continue" keyword returns control to the start of one of these constructs, while the
"break" keyword transfers control to the statement following one. In C++, the "for" keyword
creates one of these objects. A program can hang if it gets stuck in an "infinite" one of these
constructs, and the "while" statement in C++ is used to create one whose commands are executed
while a certain condition is true. For 10 points, name these programming control flow structures that

The stability of the continuous parameter type can be determined by Foster-Lyapunov criteria, and the
application of Dynkin's formula can demonstrate that they are Harris recurrent. If it is possible to go from
each state to every other state, then they are ergodic, and the rate at which they converge to a stationary
distribution is the mixing rate. Ehrenfest, Bernoulli and Laplace used them to develop discrete models for
the exchange of gas molecules between two containers. The Gibbs sampler is an example of the Monte

Kelly's lemma states that for a continuous one of these entities, the forward-time stationary
distribution and the reverse-time stationary distribution are identical. Kolmogorov's criterion is used
to determine whether these constructs are reversible, and if every sub-component of these entities is
aperiodic and positive-recurrent, they are called ergodic. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and
Gibbs sampling are examples of algorithms that attempt to construct one of these with an
equilibrium distribution equal to the (*) sampling probability distribution; those algorithms are named
for both Monte Carlo and these entities. A classic example of one of these is the drunkard's walk, in which

Until its replacement by the Furer algorithm, the Schonhage-Strassen algorithm was the
asymptotically fastest way of doing this to large numbers. One version, sometimes known as
"mediation and duplation" and originally found on the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, involves as one

When this operation is applied to two quaternions [kwa-TEHR-nee-ons], it is anticommutative. If this
operation is applied to a function and the derivative of another function, the result can be integrated by

The Toom-Cook and Karatsuba algorithms do this operation. In a field, all but one of the elements have
an inverse for this operation. A capital pi is used to denote repeatedly doing this over an index. This
operation on matrices is non-commutative and requires that the number of columns in the first matrix
equals the number of rows in the second. Repeatedly doing this is called exponentiation. For 10 points,

Anatolii Karatsuba determined an efficient way to perform this operation on large numbers. Skew fields
may not commute under this operation, but fields must. Though this operation is commutative for real
numbers, it is not commutative for matrices. Using logarithms, this operation can be used to find powers,
while logarithms allow addition to be used to perform this operation. The identity for this operation on real

Furer's algorithm is the asymptotically fastest method for doing this task, replacing the SchonhageStrassen algorithm in 2007. One recursive method for doing this task has a run time of "big-O of n to
the log 3 power," surpassing the "big-O of n squared" time of traditional methods. That divide and
conquer algorithm is a specific case of the Toom-Cook algorithm and was developed by Anatolii (*)
Karatsuba. Another way to perform this operation is to decompose the inputs into polynomials and use a

This man proved the isometric embeddability of abstract Riemannian manifolds, and that work was shown
to be applicable to the periods of celestial orbits by Jurgen Moser. In 1994 he shared the Nobel Prize in
Economical Sciences with Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi. He's best known for positing a game

In his later work, this man has addressed the problem of partial agency. Braess's paradox
concerns how adding capacity to a network can decrease its performance when a concept named for
this man is not optimal. An important model developed by this man was expanded upon by John
Harsanyi, who added factors for predictability. Other examples of his idea at work are coordination
(*) games such as the prisoner's dilemma. For 10 points, name the Princeton economist whose 1994 Nobel
Prize was awarded for his work on a namesake "equilibrium" within game theory.

Euclidean space in his namesake "embedding theorem." This thinker is best known for a concept proved by
the Brouwer Fixed Point theorem which describes a situation in which no person will change his strategy
while knowing the strategy of his opponent. For 10 points, name this subject of a biography by Sylvia Nasar

A theorem this person developed on inverse function theorems on Banach [bah-NAHK] spaces is now
named after him and a person who applied it, Jurgen Moser. That theorem was used to develop this person's

the namesake of the bargaining game, which he solved in a way that is Pareto [pah-REE-toe] efficient. His
name is also attached to the solution of the Prisoner's Dilemma and several other problems from game
theory with his namesake equilibrium. Name this mathematician who was the subject of the book and film A
Beautiful Mind.

1994 Nobel Prize in Economics. For 10 points, name this mathematician whose struggles with
schizophrenia are depicted in his biography A Beautiful Mind.
ANSWER: John Forbes Nash, Junior
They are absorbing states for learning via fictitious play, but Shapley showed in 1964 that convergence to
these does not always occur. Dynamic programming and self-generation techniques were used by
Fudenberg, Maskin, and Levine to establish the existence of its public perfect refinement when players only
use publicly available historical information. While it is the best result that can be supported in one-shot
games, the folk theorem implies that it can be improved for repeated games. FTP, name this game
theoretical situation in which when all players are best-responding to their opponents- play.
ANSWER: Nash equilibrium
Reinhard Selten added more criteria to this idea to account for small accidental perturbations so that they be
"trembling hand perfect." This concept requires that any two participant's beliefs about a third participant
be the same, and also requires that no action involved is "strictly dominated" by another. An example of it
that does not have this pure-strategy form of it is the matching pennies game; in the Prisoner's Dilemma, the
only instance of it is when both participants defect. For 10 points, name this concept in game theory, in
which each player's set of actions is a best response to the other player, and which is named after a
schizophrenic mathematician.
ANSWER: Nash Equilibrium
Reinhard Selten proposed a "trembling hand" version of this concept. A more specific version of this
concept requires it to hold for every subgame; that version is the "subgame perfect" type of this
concept. Iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies preserves these entities, but allowing
weak dominance does not, and in one, each player plays a best response to the others' strategies. For 10
points, name this concept from game theory identifying a strategy profile where no player can benefit by
unilaterally changing strategies, a type of equilibrium named for a Nobel-winning economist.
ANSWER: Nash equilibrium [accept just Nash after "equilibrium" is read; prompt equilibrium before it is read]
Mertens and Zamir proved the mathematical foundations for one method of solving for these, which
involves a transformation from incomplete information to a state space. The possibility of that type
of these entities was argued for in the paper "Agreeing to Disagree" by Robert Aumann, while
Reinhart Selten developed another extension to them that takes into account perturbations and is
known as the "trembling hand." Folk Theorems deal with their existence over protracted periods of
time, while ones which take (*) belief systems into account are referred to as "Bayesian." Pure ones are
always evolutionarily stable, and backward induction can be used to find the "subgame perfect" type of
these situations. Mixed-strategy ones are found by applying the minimax theorem to pure-strategy ones with
best response analysis, and mutual defection fulfills the only one of these for the Prisoner's Dilemma. FTP,
name this game theory situation in which no player can change strategy without making himself worse off,
named for a notably schizophrenic Princeton mathematician.
ANSWER: Bayesian-Nash equilibrium (prompt on just "equilibrium")
A variation to this concept that includes perturbations in decision models is known as trembling-hand
perfect. This concept holds when certain sets are non-empty, convex, compact subsets of a Euclidean space
by the Kakutani Fixed Point Theorem, and the utility function is continuous and quasi-concave. A Bayesian
one is found by anticipating the plans of others, and they were worked on by Harsanyi and Selten as well as
their namesake, who introduced them in the paper Non-Cooperative Games. For 10 points, name this idea
in which each player's strategy choice is a best-response to the strategies played by his rivals, a game theory
equilibrium named for a schizophrenic.
ANSWER: Nash equilibrium [accept Nash after "equilibrium" is read, prompt on it before]
In a network, implementing this situation can cause slowdown, known as Braess- paradox. Adding a
probability element creates the "trembling hand" example, and they can be found by finding the row and
column maxima in a payoff matrix. Chicken has three of them, with one involving mixed strategies, while
the stag hunt and prisoner's dilemma has only one. For 10 points, identify this situation from game theory
in which no player can gain anything by changing their strategy unilaterally, named for a Princeton
mathematician.
ANSWER: Nash equilibrium
Rousseau famously wrote about a variation of this idea with his analysis of the Stag Hunt. Weak and Strong
versions of this exist, and Cournot analyzed a variant of this concept in his model of duopoly, which gives
the amount that both firms will choose to produce if they take into account the other's actions. Many of
these can exist for a given model, and determining one of these is often found using a payoff matrix. FTP,
identify this concept from game theory, which gives the solution to a game in which no player can improve
himself by changing his strategy unilaterally, given what the other players are doing.

of this function's Maclaurin series equals the quantity x minus one, quantity to the nth power, over n. This
function can be integrated by multiplying it by x and subtracting x, and its derivative equals the reciprocal
of x. Multiplying two numbers together and then applying this function has the same result as applying this
function separately to the two numbers and adding the results, and exponents inside these functions can
instead be used to multiply outside of them. This function can be transformed to other bases by dividing it

Russell defined them by defining a function that established a set consisting of x union y, where x belonged
to the set being operated on and y was not an element of x. A well ordering can be defined on these based

A space has this property if and only if any two disjoint closed subsets can be separated by a

meaning they are of length one. Taking the cross product of two vectors in a plane will yield this vector,
which determines the plane's orientation. The empirical 68-95-99.5 rule applies to a distribution described
by this non-eponymous adjective. For 10 points, name this adjective which describes the Gaussian
distribution, or bell curve.
ANSWER: normal [do not accept "perpendicular"; do not accept "orthonormal"]
This type of matrix has orthogonal eigenvectors that span its space. A vector called this is the
ratio of the tangent vector's derivative divided by the curvature. For a given surface, that vector is
the cross product of two non-parallel vectors in the surface, and its direction can be found using the
(*) right-hand rule. For finite mean and variance, the cumulative density function of a sample will approach
a distribution called this as the sample size increases, as shown in the central limit theorem. For 10 points,
name this word given to a distribution that forms the bell curve.
ANSWER: normal
A matrix operator of this type commutes with its conjugate transpose, while a number of this type is a real
number whose base b digital expansion has uniform density. A subgroup of a group is called this if it is
invariant under conjugation, while a mode of a system is called this when it is associated with a resonant
frequency. For 10 points, give this mathematical adjective, which can also be used to describe the vector
that is perpendicular to a surface.
ANSWER: normal [do not accept orthogonal]
The tobit model uses a truncated form of this, and if 2 variables are unrelated but follow this pattern,
then their sum follows this too. Given a large number of independent variables, their sum will
converge toward it according to the central limit theorem. Its formula is 1 over the square root of 2
pi times the population standard deviation times e to the negative x minus the mean squared over 2
sigma squared. Subject of the empirical rule, for ten points, name this distribution that resembles a bell
curve.
ANSWER: Normal distribution or Gaussian distribution (do not accept standard normal, or anything that modifies the word normal)
One quick way to test how similar a data set is to this mathematical object is to draw a Q-Q plot and look
for a linear relationship. Because it is described by a variant of the function "e to the negative x squared", its
CDF is based on the error function. This mathematical object is equal to the t-distribution in the limit when t
goes to infinity. Z-scores are computed based on a standard version of it. The means of random variables
from any distribution will follow one of these distributions, according to the central limit theorem. For 10
points, name this probability distribution that is described by the 68-95-99.7 rule and is shaped like a bell.
ANSWER: normal distribution [or Gaussian distribution; accept standard normal distribution; accept z- distribution until "Z-scores" is read]
The equation of the standard form of this entity is e to the quantity negative x squared over two all
divided by the square root of two pi. If the number of trials is high, the binomial distribution can be
approximated by this distribution. As the sample size becomes large, the distribution of a population
of means approaches this distribution according to the (*) central limit theorem. If a random variable
has this distribution, then approximately 68% of its values fall within one standard deviation of the mean.
For 10 points, name this probability distribution often referred to as the bell curve.
ANSWER: normal distribution [or Gaussian distribution]
This distribution's ability to describe a population is the subject of the Shapiro-Wilks test. This distribution
has at most two nonzero cumulants and forms a straight line on a Q-Q plot. It approximately describes the
mean of a large number of random variables, according to the central limit theorem. This distribution,
whose "standard" version has a mean of zero and a variance of one, has 68 percent of its values within one
standard deviation of the mean. For 10 points, name the probability distribution whose graph is a symmetric
bell curve.
ANSWER: normal distribution [or Gaussian distribution; prompt on bell curve before mentioned]
The kurtosis is a measure of how badly a distribution deviates from this kind of distribution. The error
function is given by the integral of this distribution. This distribution is characterized by an "e to the
negative x squared" term, and in this distribution, ninety-five percent of the population is found within two
standard deviations of the mean. For 10 points, name this distribution that is also known as a Gaussian
distribution or a bell curve.
ANSWER: normal distribution [or Gaussian distribution before it is read; prompt on bell curve]
The Box-Mueller transformation converts a uniform distribution to this distribution. If the sum
of two random variables has this distribution, then both of those random variables have this
distribution by Cramer's Theorem. The distribution of sample means of any distribution converges
to this distribution by the Central Limit Theorem. The integral of this function, the error function,
allows one to calculate (*) probabilities based on z-scores, which represent the number of standard
deviations away from the mean of this distribution. For 10 points, name this distribution that resembles a
bell curve.
ANSWER: normal distribution [or Gaussian distribution; prompt on bell curve]
The Behrens-Fisher problem deals with testing whether two of these distributions have the same mean, and
in least squares data-fitting, it is assumed that errors follow this distribution. As sample size approaches
infinity, this distribution is a limiting case of the binomial distribution, and this distribution is often used as
an approximation in accordance with the central limit theorem. Defined in terms of its mean and variance,
For 10 points, name this continuous probability distribution sometimes called the Gaussian distribution or
the "bell curve".
ANSWER: Normal Distribution [prompt on Gaussian Distribution before mentioning; prompt on Bel Curve before mentioning]
This entity always has a kurtosis of zero, and the area under this curve between any two points is
proportional to the difference in the error function at those points. As the number of samples increases, the
binomial distribution approaches this curve, whose standard form has mean zero and variance one. By the
Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of the means of a set of random variables will converge to this
distribution. For 10 points, give this common distribution sometimes called the "bell curve."
ANSWER: normal distribution curve [or Gaussian distribution curve; or bell curve before read]
The flux of a vector field across a surface is given by the double integral, over the surface, of the vector
field dotted with this quantity. The direction of this vector determines the orientation of a surface. For a
plane, it can be found by taking the cross product of any two vectors in the plane; for a curve in space, it is
equal to the derivative of the tangent vector. The direction of this vector, along with any point in the plane,
defines the plane. For 10 points, name this vector, which is perpendicular to a surface.
ANSWER: the normal vector [or N; or unit normal vector]
For a binary expression x in Boolean algebra this operator is defined as one minus x. It cannot be defined
with only conjunction and disjunction, and DeMorgan's Laws explain how it is distributed over
expressions with logical OR and logical AND. For 10 points, name this unary operator which makes true
boolean expressions into false ones and false expressions into true ones.
ANSWER: logical not [or negation; or logical complementation; do not accept "bitwise not"]
This operation is the basis for both of the two universal logic gates that can be used to build any logic
circuit. In C and Java, the bitwise form of this operation is represented by a tilde. Performing this operation
on the first bit of an IEEE (I triple E) 754 floating point number changes its sign. In C and many other
programming languages, the logical form of this operation is represented by an exclamation point. For 10
points, name this operation that returns 1 if the input is 0 and 0 if the input is 1.
ANSWER: not [or negation]
Gates representing this operation are symbolized with a triangle with a circle at its tip. According to modus
tollens, this operation applied to Q implies this operation applied to P, if P implies Q. In Java, this operation
is represented with a "bang" or exclamation point. This operation may be represented as a tilde before a
proposition. DeMorgan's Laws give the result when this operation is applied to binary conjunction and
disjunction. The inverse of a logical statement requires this operation to be applied to both statements.
When applied to binary 0, it results in 1. For 10 points, name this binary operation that gives the logical
opposite.
ANSWER: NOT [or negation; or word forms; or inverse or word forms; or logical complement]
The makeup of this set is described by Fagin's theorem and the concept of natural proofs was introduced to
argue against certain approaches for finding particular substructures within it. The Valiant-Vazirani theorem
gives a way for this set to be collapsed. Changing the definition of this set to harness probability results in
the Arthur-Merlin protocol. The intersection of this set and its complement includes primality. It contains
both the problem of discrete logarithms and deciding whether a graph has a given size clique. Richard Karp
gave a list of 21 problems that are as hard as any in this complexity class, including the Boolean
satisfiability problem. This is the set of problems which have a polynomial-time verifier. For 10 points,
name this complexity class that may or may not strictly contain P.
ANSWER: NP [or Nondeterministic Polynomial time]
The pointer of this name does not point to any valid address. This name is given to the ASCII character
used to terminate c strings. The kernel of a matrix is also known as this space. This term also applies to the
empty set. The statistical results of an experiment can reject the hypothesis of this name which assumes that
no significant effect occurred. For 10 points, name this term that refers to things with out value, that when
combined with void describes a contract without legal effect.
ANSWER: null
The competitive exclusion principle serves as this type of statement for ecology and the steady state model
was once one of these in cosmology. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the molecular clock form one of
these statements for evolution, based on the presumption that most mutant alleles (uh-LEELS) are neutral.
Famous ones rejected by experiment include the luminiferous (loo-muh-NIF-er-us) ether and the plum
pudding model, and a Type II error occurs when this statement is accepted even though it is false. Often
assuming no correlation between two events, name this type of experimental statement, symbolized H-subnaught, which holds that the assumed explanation is the correct one.
ANSWER: null hypothesis [prompt on H-sub-naught or H-sub-zero before "naught"; prompt on a partial answer]
This entity's name reflects the fact that there is no difference between the unknown population parameter
and a constant usually denoted theta. If a sample falls within the "critical region," then this entity is assumed
to be not true. The power of tests of this statement can be improved if one uses a one-sided test rather than a
two-sided test. When the level of significance is greater than the p value, this entity should be accepted,
because if you reject, you-re more likely to make a type-one error. After performing a z-test, this entity is
accepted if the z-score is sufficiently low. For 10 points, name this statistical hypothesis that may be
rejected in favor of the alternative one.
ANSWER: null hypothesis [accept null hypothesis after "hypothesis" is read]
BCD, one way of storing these objects, is close to the way humans use them, and the Gray code
representation of them differs among adjacent points by one bit. Commonly used in microprocessors
is two's complement notation for denoting these objects, and one format used in scientific computing
comes in standard and double forms specified by IEEE 754. That technique uses a mantissa, sign bit,
and (*) exponent and is called floating point, while most operations on these are fixed point and are done
by
the Arithmetic Logic Unit. For 10 points, name these abstract entities which can be shifted, added, or
multiplied by a computer.
ANSWER: numbers
This task is performed by using a Chebyshev expansion of the relevant function in the ClenshawCurtis method. It's not parameter or posterior distribution estimation, but accomplishing this task by
averaging across samples from updating conditional distributions is known as Gibbs sampling, which
is an application of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for accomplishing this task. For evenly
spaced intervals, this process can be done using the (*) Newton-Cotes rules, whose closed type of degree
two is equivalent to Simpson's rule. For uncomplicated functions, this can be done precisely by hand using
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. For 10 points, identify this procedure that can approximate the area
under a curve.
ANSWER: numerical integration [or numerical quadrature; anti-prompt on "automatic integration"; prompt on "integration"]
A time-reversible and symplectic method for performing this task uses a technique called
"leapfrogging" and is often used when the model in question is a dynamical system. While
performing ragdoll physics calculations, the central difference is computed as part of an algorithm
designed for this task named after Loup Verlet ["Ver-lay"]; that method improves upon the simplest
method for doing this, which is an algorithm that takes an initial point and calculates the next point
by evaluating a function at x and y, then multiplying that expression by the (*) step size. That simple
method for doing this task is a first-order method, which means that the error varies with the square of the
step size. The most common family of algorithms for performing this task are the Runge-Kutta methods; a
simple example of which is the Euler method. For 10 points, name this task of approximately computing a
definite integral.

This is the run time of a lookup operation of an element when using a Bloom Filter. When efficiently
implemented using up-trees, the find function in a disjoint set makes look-up times for elements of a
given set be this. Linked lists are often implemented in lieu of arrays because insertion into one has
this run time on average with a linked list, even though directly accessing an individual array element
has this run time. Also the run time of all bitwise operations, it is also the run time for a function that makes
use of a "bucket array." For 10 points, identify this big-O run time that is the average look-up time for
hashes, a run time that does not change with respect to any given property.
ANSWER: O(1) run time or constant run time
The diamond problem occurs when using these programming constructs during the "multiple" type of a
certain process. Except for private member variables, languages like Smalltalk are entirely comprised of
these constructs, lacking even primitive types. Functors are these kinds of things specifically designed for
function use. In C++, "the rule of big three" refers to the necessity of writing an assignment operator,
destructor, and copy constructor for these things, and these structures are instantiations of classes. A
programming philosophy named for these entities emphasizes polymorphism, inheritance and
encapsulation. For 10 points, name this these things that certain programming paradigm "orients" towards.
ANSWER: objects [accept classes until mentioned]
On UML diagrams, these things are shown to have a "has a" relationship with a filled-in diamond.
According to the book Design Patterns, a factory method is a common way to create them. In subtype
polymorphism, one of these things can behave as though it belongs to different types. These things can be
created by constructor methods. They can borrow attributes and behavior from their superclasses through
inheritance. For 10 points, name these instances of classes, the namesake of a type of programming
exemplified by C++ and Java.
ANSWER: objects
JSON ["Jason"] is a "notation", inspired by JavaScript, for writing these things. They usually
feature encapsulation, meaning that access to their fields is controlled. These things can inherit
from supertypes and are created by constructors. In Java, this type includes methods named
hashCode() and equals(), and everything except primitives inherits from it. C++ ["see plus plus"]
uses a paradigm named for this term, which is abbreviated "OOP". Give this term for an instance of
a class, around which a certain type of programming is "oriented".
ANSWER: objects
Languages in this paradigm often contain the special variable "this" or "self" that implement open
recursion. Data of one type can be used as data of another type by the use of subtype polymorphism in this
paradigm. By concealing the way data is implemented in this paradigm, one can organize data with
encapsulation. The procedures associated with the namesakes of this paradigm are called methods. For 15
points, name this programming paradigm that includes languages like Java.
ANSWER: object-oriented programming [or OOP]
The Delphi programming language is a variation of Pascal developed to encourage this paradigm. Its
central principles include encapsulation, the concept of hiding internal data from public access, and
inheritance, or the ability to create derived classes. Languages designed explicitly to support this method of
programming include Smalltalk, though common languages like C++ and Java employ it extensively. For
10 points, name this programming paradigm that focuses on using the namesake instances of classes to
represent problems.
ANSWER: object-oriented programming [prompt on anything involving objects]
A non-Chinese group called the Gang of Four authored the textbook Design Patterns about this
system. One feature of this system is a recursive feature often implementing the keyword "this." A
feature of this methodology is the ability to "override." Major tenets of this system include limiting
the scope of a variable, called (*) encapsulation, and the ability of a variable to have more than one form,
called polymorphism. In this paradigm contrasted with "functional" languages, the namesake constructs are
instances of classes. For ten points, name this common programming paradigm exemplified by languages
like C++ and Java.
ANSWER: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
This shape can be graphed by setting the sums of multiples of the absolute values of x+y, x-y, x, and y equal
to a constant. Six of these figures combine with eight triangles to form the surface of a truncated cube, and
placing two of these shapes and a square at each vertex tessellates the plane. The regular version of this
shape has interior angles that measure three times as large as its central angle, which means that an interior
angle also measures three times an exterior angle. A convex version of this shape has a total of 20
diagonals, and each vertex is the endpoint of five of them. Name this polygon with eight sides.
ANSWER: octagon
The volume of one of these shapes can be found by first cubing an edge length, then multiplying by the
square root of two, and dividing by three, and each of their vertices can be placed in a coordinate system by
giving each vertex two coordinates equal to zero and one coordinate equal to plus or minus a constant.
Their surface area can be calculated by squaring an edge length and multiplying by two times the square
root of three, and the vertices of this shape can be used as the center of the faces of a cube. These shapes are
essentially two square-based pyramids with the squares covering each other. Name this Platonic solid
which, like the tetrahedron and icosahedron, has triangular faces.
ANSWER: octahedron
This type of vertex cannot exist in an Eulerian (OIL-air-ian)graph. There are no known perfect numbers
of this type. sine of x is this type of function, while cosine of x is not. Functions of this type satisfy the
condition f of negative x equals negative f of x, and their graphs are symmetric with respect to the origin.
The sum of two consecutive integers of this parity is always divisible by four. All integers of this type can
be written in the form 2n + 1 for some integer n. For 10 points, give this term, the opposite of even.
ANSWER: odd
There is a bijection between the number of integer partitions with distinct parts and those with parts solely
of this type. Functions of this type only have sine terms appearing in their associated Fourier series, and
they remain unchanged when rotated 180 degrees about the origin and are therefore symmetric with respect
to the origin. Those functions follow the property that f of x equals negative f of negative x, while numbers
of this type can generally be written in the form 2n+1. For 10 points, give this adjective describing any
whole number that can be expressed as one plus an even number.
ANSWER: odd
The sign of a permutation is negative one if the permutation has this distinction. There are no
known perfect numbers with this distinction. The Taylor expansion for sine consists of x to the n over
n factorial where n is positive and this. A function is this if f of x equals (*) negative f of negative x.
These numbers are congruent to one mod two. With the exception of two, all prime numbers are this. For
10 points, name this distinction given to numbers that are not even.
ANSWER: odd
The sum of the first n ones of these numbers is a perfect square. There are no known perfect numbers
that can be described by this term. The integral, from negative to positive infinity, of a function described
by this term is always zero. Functions with this descriptor can be represented by the equation f of x equals
negative f of negative x and include the sine function. Those functions have rotational symmetry about the
origin. All but one prime is this type of number. For 10 points identify this term that describes numbers not
divisible by two, unlike even numbers.
ANSWER: odd
For any integer N, the sum of all numbers having this property from 1 to N must be a perfect square.
It has been proven that for all numbers less than ten to the three hundredth power, there are no perfect
numbers with this property. The tangent and sine functions both have this property, which applies to any
function for which f of x plus f of negative x equals zero, and is therefore symmetric about the origin. Every
binary number with this property must end in 1, and all prime numbers but the smallest have this property.
For 10 points, identify this class of numbers, which leave a remainder when divided by two.
ANSWER: odd numbers

In set theory, this number can be defined using the set that contains only zero. If a function approaches this
positive value raised to infinity, then it is indeterminate. This number equals the length of each vector in an

The integral of the Dirac [dih-RAK] delta function over any interval containing 0 has this value. The
probability of any event plus the probability of the event's complement equals this number. It
represents (*) "true" in Boolean algebra. The logarithm of this number, with any base, is zero, since any

The Riemann hypothesis conjectures that every non-trivial root of the zeta function has a real part
equal to this. Multiplying this number by the quantity one plus the cosine of two x is equal to cosine

Every graph has a bipartite subgraph with at least this proportion of its edges.
Pick's Theorem states that the area of a lattice polygon is equal to I minus one plus this value times B, and
thus this is the smallest possible area of a lattice triangle. The Riemann Hypothesis conjectures that all non-

ANSWER: one-to-one [accept injective]
Topological spaces are termed Lindelof if every cover with this property has a countable subcover, while
the existence of a finite subcover for every cover of this type commonly defines a compact space. A set
possesses this property if every point in the set has an epsilon-neighborhood in the set. This property is not
necessarily possessed by the intersection of an infinite number of sets of possessing it because that

A theorem named for this type of mapping says that non-constant analytic functions map sets of this type to
other sets of this type. All the elements of a topology possess this property with respect to the topology. For
a compact set, every cover of this type has a finite subcover. The interior of any set has this property, and
every point in a set with this property is an interior point, meaning that it has a neighborhood contained
within the set. A set of this type does not contain its boundary points, and intervals of this type on the real
line are denoted with round parentheses. For 10 points, name this property, possessed by sets whose
complements are closed.
ANSWER: open
Given some line, a nonintersecting oriented curve constitutes this kind of meander, while in game
theory, this kind of "-loop model" assumes that players cannot remember their opponents' play, and
in functional analysis the Banach-Schauder theorem refers to surjective continuous linear
transformations. Invariance of domain holds that any locally injective continuous function between
two manifolds must be this kind of (*) map. In a metric space, this adjective applies to every set such that
for all points in that set, there exists a neighborhood around that point contained in the set. Denoted for an
interval with parentheses, rather than square brackets, FTP, identify this term describing a set that does not
contain its boundary, also the complement of a closed set.
ANSWER: open
For a set with this property and a function f with singularity at z in that set, f comes arbitrarily close
to any complex value around z by the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem. In T1 spaces, every pair of
points is contained in two neighborhoods with this property that do not intersect. A G-sub-delta set is
a countable intersection of sets with this property, and (*) intersections of infinite sets with this property
do not necessarily have this property. The largest subset of a space that has this property is called the
interior, and metric spaces have this property if each of their points has a neighborhood around it that is in
the set. For 10 points, name this property used to describe sets that do not contain their boundary points.
ANSWER: open
A Grothendieck topology defines a sieve as a collection of subsets of a set with this property that
themselves have this property. The Lindehof condition for a space requires every cover of this type to
have a countable subcover. Generally, two points are "separated" if each point is contained in a set of
this type that doesn't contain the other. In the particular point topology, all sets that contain an arbitrary
point are of this type. A subset U of a metric space has this property if every point therein has a
neighborhood inside U. Sets have this property in R^n when every point is an interior point. For 10 points,
name this topological property, possessed by a set if its complement is closed.
ANSWER: open
A map has this property if it is a surjective continuous linear operator between Banach spaces, by the
Banach-Schauder theorem. In a Baire space, a countable intersection of dense sets with this property will
also be dense. If a collection of subsets and any union of those subsets has this property, those subsets
define a topology. A space is compact if every cover with this property has a finite subcover. A set has this
property if every point is an interior point, so that each point has a neighborhood entirely contained within
the set. The set of points less than one unit from the origin is the unit ball with this property. On the real
line, intervals of this type don't include their endpoints. For 10 points, name this property that is possessed
by the complements of closed sets.
ANSWER: open [accept word forms]
Andrew Tanenbaum created a "mini" one of these that was widely used as a teaching tool. The game Space
Travel inspired Ken Thompson to develop one of these that make use of "pipes." Multics greatly influenced
one of these for which X-11 provides a graphical user interface. Fedora and Debian are distributions of one
of these that was developed by Linus Torvalds and has a penguin as a mascot. Updates to another one of
these were formerly named for types of big cats. For 10 points, name this type of software exemplified by
Linux and Microsoft Windows.
ANSWER: operating systems [or OS; accept Unix on an early buzz; prompt on "kernel"]
An older example of this software was Solaris, which was used mostly on SPARC systems. This
type of software implements schedulers to manage threads, and is loaded by a boot loader. A central
component of this type of software is the kernel. This type of software provides a large contiguous
virtual memory, which can be supplemented by swap space or a (*) page file. It interfaces with
computer hardware and applications run on top of it. For 10 points, identify this software that includes Mac
OS X and Windows.
ANSWER: operating systems
One variant of this logical operation computes the sum, not the carry out, in half adders and full
adders. A bitwise variant of this logical operation is represented by a caret in C, is true only when the
bits differ, and is the exclusive type. In C, the bitwise and logical forms of this operation are
represented by a single pipe symbol and two pipe symbols, respectively. Taking the (*) union of a set
is equivalent to this logical operation. According to De Morgan's laws, the not of the expression that
contains this operation performed on A and B is equal to not A dot not B. It is often represented by plus.
For 10 points, name this operation that is true if any input is true and is contrasted with and.
ANSWER: inclusive or [or logical disjunction; accept U or set union before "union" is read; accept plus before it is read]
This point lies opposite the Nagel point on a Fuhrmann circle, and its distance from the Nagel point is half
its distance from the circumcenter. Its distance from the sides of its triangle are proportional to the secants
of the angles opposite those sides. Along with the nine-point circle center, centroid, and circumcenter, this
point is on the Euler (OI-ler) line. For obtuse triangles, this point is located outside its triangle, and for right
triangles, this point is located at the right angle. Name this intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle.
ANSWER: orthocenter
The groups of this type are ones that given a vector space over a field, preserve a non-degenerate
quadratic form over that space. Euler's conjecture on Graeco-Roman Squares was refuted for n=6 by
finding this sort of matrix. Householder matricies are always symmetric and this. Linear transformations of
this type preserve inner products. Fourier's theorem is dependent on trignometric functions having this
property, which means the integral from negative pi to pi of sin kx times sin jx dx is only non-zero for k
equals j. If the vectors in a basis are of unit length and this, then they are orthonormal. If the dot product of
two vectors is zero, the vectors are this to each other. For 10 points, name this adjective used to describe
lines or curves that are perpendicular.
ANSWER: orthogonal
If a basis has this property, then any vector can be expressed as the sum of projections onto its vectors.
In addition to normalizing a set of vectors, the Gram-Schmidt process gives them this property. The
gradient of a function has this relationship to its level curves. In the equation of a plane, the vector
whose components correspond to the coefficients has this relationship to the plane. If two vectors
have this property, then the product of their magnitudes equals the magnitude of their cross product,
and their dot product equals zero. If two lines in the Cartesian plane have this property, then their
slopes are opposite reciprocals. Name this property of lines that meet at right angles.
ANSWER: orthogonal [accept mutually perpendicular or normal; prompt on orthonormal or answers mentioning right angles]
A linear transformation has this property if it preserves the inner product, and the functions sine and cosine
have this property with respect to the Lesbesgue measure. This type of matrix is a unitary matrix with all
entries real, and the Gram-Schmidt process can take a set of vectors and produce another set that is both this
and normal, a special kind of basis. This is also the relationship between two vectors with a dot product of
zero and two lines whose slopes are negative reciprocals. FTP, identify this property possessed by the
diagonals of a rhombus and the sides of a square.
ANSWER: orthogonal (accept perpendicular after the phrase "dot product")
In QR decomposition, a matrix is factored into one in this form and one in upper triangular form. A
linear transformation, T, with this property satisfies the equality inner product of two vectors v and w
equals the inner product of T v and T w. This type of matrix preserves the inner product and yields the
identity when multiplied by its transpose. If a set of vectors satisfies this property, then it is linearly
independent. A basis whose vectors are of unit length and have this property can be created with the
Gram-Schmidt process. Two vectors with this property have a dot product of zero. For 10 points, identify
this property of things that intersect at right angles.
ANSWER: orthogonal [or word forms]
A matrix with this property and one that is upper triangular is given by the QR decomposition.
Given a linearly independent set of vectors x, a process that gives a set with this property computes a
set of vectors v as v-sub-n equals x-sub-n minus the sum from i equals one to n minus one of the
projection of v-sub-n along x-sub-i. That process is named for Gram & Schmidt and gives a basis
that can later be normalized. The standard unit (*) vectors of the Cartesian coordinate system all have
this property with respect to each other. Two vectors have this property if their inner product, or dot
product in lower dimensions, is equal to zero. For 10 points, identify this property that two lines have if
they are perpendicular.
ANSWER: orthogonality [or orthonormal; or perpendicular until it is read]
One sequence of polynomials with this property begins one, then x, then three-halves x squared minus one
half; the integral of any product of two of those from negative one to one equals zero. This term also refers
to a specialization of unitary matrices, namely, matrices whose transposes equal their inverses. A set with
this property can be produced by recursively subtracting vector projections; that is a basis produced by the
Gram-Schmidt process. This term also describes vectors whose inner product, or dot product, is zero; as
well as two lines whose slopes are opposite reciprocals. Give this property which applies to adjacent sides
of a rectangle.

This operating system is based on Darwin, a flavor of BSD. This operating system includes the "Terminal"
application, through which Unix commands may be entered into a command line. The visual interface of
this operating system is called Aqua. Specific versions of this operating system include Tiger, Jaguar, and,
most recently Snow Leopard. For 10 points, name this operating system found on Apple Computers.

An ensemble learning approach to finding these things relies on running the LOF algorithm
repeatedly and is a form of "feature bagging". The RANSAC method can be used in the presence of
large numbers of these things. Grubbs method for finding them relies on a test statistic consisting of
the max residual over the standard deviation. Winsorization is one method of dealing with these
values, which are also the motivation behind the development of so-called (*) "robust" methods. The
existence of a large number of these entities assuming a normal prior may indicate a high kurtosis in the
underlying distribution. These things are generally plotted above or below the "whiskers" in a box-andwhisker plot and are usually one point five times the interquartile range beyond the upper or lower quartile.
For 10 points, name these points in a data set which do not fit within the presumed distribution.
ANSWER: outliers
One method for identifying these involves dividing gap by range and is known as Dixon's Q test.
Chauvenet's [shao-veh-nay-z] criterion identifies these when a probability times the sample size is less than
one-half, while the critical value of a t-distribution is used to look for these using Grubbs- test. Other
methods work by adding or subtracting a multiple of the interquartile range to one of the quartiles.
Statistical measures that can be used effectively without eliminating these are called robust, and these are
sometimes defined as any measurement more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean. Name these
data points that do not fit in with the rest of the data because they are abnormally high or low.
ANSWER: outliers [accept outlying points or similar answers]
One condition with this name caused the destruction of the Flight 501 of the Ariane 5 launch system.
In the x86 processor, the TEST instruction clears its namesake flag, and the DieHard allocator prevents
the "heap" form of this from happening. "Trampolining" is a notable method of exploiting the stack
buffer form of this phenomenon, and the arithmetic form of it excludes division by zero. Infinite
recursion is a common cause of the stack form of this condition. For 10 points, name this term referring
to crashes caused by an inundation of information or data.
ANSWER: overflows
Steve's class adds a spatial constraint to this class, and an open problem concerns whether Nick's class
equals this class. The Klee-Minty cubes show that the simplex method is not in this class, while Khachian's
ellipsoid method was the first example of a linear programming solution in this class. By Schaefer's
dichotomy theorem, the Boolean satisfiability theorem for both Horn and anti-Horn formulas is in this class,
and for any formula is either in this complexity class or in NP-complete. This complexity class contains
problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine. For 10 points, name this class of problems
that can be solved in polynomial time, which may or may not equal NP.
ANSWER: P [or early polynomial time]
This shape can be generated by drawing an infinite number of lines that are perpendicular to segments
coming from a fixed point where those segments hit a fixed line. This shape also can be generated by
finding all of the points so that a right angle is formed at the y-axis with one ray going through a fixed point
on the x-axis and one ray going through the point on this shape with twice the y-coordinate as the point on
the y-axis. Any ray coming from the fixed point on the x-axis that bounced off this shape the way light
bounces off a mirror would travel parallel to the x-axis. This shape is also defined as the set of points
equidistant from a fixed line, called a directrix, and a fixed point, called a focus, and this shape also is the
conic section with an eccentricity of one. Name this shape generated by quadratic functions such as y equals
x squared.
ANSWER: parabolas [prompt on quadratics]
This shape is the inverse curve of a cardioid. Its three-dimensional analog is given by z over c equals x
squared over a squared plus y squared over b squared, and it can be represented in polar coordinates by r
equals d over one plus or minus cosine theta. A method of approximating integrals using these shapes is
named for Simpson. Light reflected off a mirror with this shape will be focused at a single point. Its
eccentricity equals one, and it may be generated by slicing a cone with a plane parallel to a straight line
along its surface. For 10 points, name this conic section which is the set of points equidistant from a line
and a point, an example of which is y equals x squared.
ANSWER: parabolas
The solution of the Poincare conjecture via Ricci flow requires a general solution of a partial
differential equation of this kind. An aberration known as a coma occurs in reflectors of this shape. The
hyperbolic version of its three-dimensional analog is shaped like a saddle, and rolling it along a straight
line produces a catenary curve. It is the locus of points equidistant from a focus and directrix, and is
produced when a plane intersects a right circular cone. For 10 points, name this conic section with an
eccentricity of 1, the shape of curves like y = x2.
ANSWER: parabola [or word forms like parabolic]
This shape's universal constant is root two plus the natural log of quantity one plus root two, and it
has only one associated Dandelin sphere. When one of these curves is rolled along its mirror image,
the cissoid of Diocles is formed, and if the focus of one of them is rolled along a straight line, a
catenary results. As one focus of an ellipse moves to infinity with the other fixed, this curve is the [*]
limit. A plane intersecting a cone parallel to its slant height forms this section. This curve is the locus of all
points equidistant from the focus and the directrix. With an eccentricity of one, for 10 points, name this
conic section, the graph of a quadratic function.
ANSWER: parabola
In polar coordinates, this curve is given by an equation that is inversely proportional to 1 over quantity 1
plus cosine of theta. If an object with this shape is mirrored, it will redirect parallel rays of light to its focus
point. In rectangular coordinates, the slope of a tangent line of this curve at x is 2 times x. All points on this
shape are equidistant from the focus point and the directrix line. For 10 points, name this curve, which in
rectangular coordinates is produced by the equation y equals x squared.
ANSWER: parabola
Each "bulb" of the Mandelbrot set is an inverse of one of these figures, because the bulbs are
cardioids. Menaechmus found a solution to the problem of doubling the cube by intersecting two of
these figures, and Joachim Jungus demonstrated that a catenary was not one of these curves. This
shape is the locus of all points equidistant from a focus and a line called a (*) directrix. This figure is
equivalent to an ellipse with one focus at infinity, and it has an eccentricity of one. For ten points, identify
this conic section, whose vertical variety is the graph of a quadratic equation, one example of which has
equation y equals x-squared.
ANSWER: parabola (accept quadratic function/curve before mentioned)
This shape can be inverted to form a cissoid [SIS-soid] of Diocles [DIE-oh-klees] or a cardioid [KAHRdee-oid]. A drawing of all lines whose x- and y-intercepts have a constant sum generates this curve. This is
generated when the x y term coefficient equals four times the product of the other two second degree
coefficients when an equation contains only second degree polynomials. This also is generated by setting
the polar r equal to a constant divided by the quantity one plus cosine theta. This is also the set of all points
equidistant from a fixed point focus and fixed line directrix. Name this shape also generated by the equation
y=x2.
ANSWER: parabola (prompt on "conic" section)
A "universal constant" associated with this curve is equal to radical two plus the natural log of the
quantity one plus radical two. That constant is the ratio of the arc length between the two points
where this curve intersects the latus rectum to the semilatus rectum. This curve is the set of points
equidistant from a point called the (*) focus and a line called the directrix. This is the only conic section
with a single vertex. For 10 points, name this curve traced out by any quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c.
ANSWER: parabola
The Tschirnhausen cubic catacaustic is a semicubical example of this figure, and a segment of one of these
is a Lissajous curve. Menaechmus studied these, which were given their current name by Apollonius, in an
attempt to achieve cube duplication. Their surface of revolution is used for car headlights as they have the
property that all light originating at their focus will be reflected parallel to their axis of symmetry. All of
these have an eccentricity of one, and are thus similar. This figure is created by slicing a cone on a plane
parallel to a straight line along its surface. Identify this conic section, defined by a focus and directrix, an
example of which is the graph of y = x2.
ANSWER: parabola [prompt on "conic section" before mentioned]
One example of this curve is the polar equation "r equals one over quantity one plus cosine theta." This
curve is defined as the locus of points equidistant from a focus and a directrix. Neglecting air resistance,
this curve can be used to model projectile motion. In rectangular coordinates, the equations of these curves
are quadratic in either x or y, but not both. It possesses a vertex and an axis of symmetry. For 10 points,
name this curve, exemplified by the equation "y equals x-squared."
ANSWER: parabola
An orbit with this shape requires a velocity of square root of 2 mu over r and is called an escape orbit.
These shapes have eccentricity of one. This figure is defined as the locus of points equidistant from a focus
and a directrix. When ignoring air resistance, this is the shape of the path of a projectile. When written as a
function of x, the formula x equals negative b over two a gives the axis of symmetry for these figures. For
10 points, name this shape, an example of which is the graph of y equals x squared.
ANSWER: parabola
The intersection of two of these figures was central to Menaechmus' solution to the cube duplication
problem. When inverted about a certain point, it becomes a cardioid. These figures are all similar to each
other, because each has an eccentricity equal to 1. A mirror made in this shape can focus all incident light
onto a single point, and it is defined as the locus of points equidistant from a focus and a directrix. In a
uniform gravitational field, a projectile's trajectory takes this shape. For 10 points, name this conic section
produced by the graph of a quadratic function.
ANSWER: parabolas
In polar coordinates, this figure can be described by the equation r times the term one plus cosine
theta equals the semilatus rectum. This is the shape of an orbit for an object at the moment it reaches,
but does not exceed, the escape velocity. Because of the ability of this shape to focus light on a point, it is
the proposed shape for Archimedes "death ray". For 10 points, identify this conic section with an
eccentricity of exactly one, defined as the set of points on a plane equidistant from a line called the directrix
and a point called a focus which is exemplified by the graph of the equation y equals x squared.
ANSWER: parabola
This shape is the circular inverse of a cardioid. This curve can be approximated by connecting crossing
pairs of equally-spaced points from two intersecting lines. Archimedes used the method of exhaustion with
inscribed triangles to compute the area of segments of this shape, and supposedly used the three-dimensional
analogue of this shape to create a heat ray. The path of an object experiencing constant nonzero acceleration 
is this shape. Every point on this shape is is equidistant from the focus and the directrix. For ten points, 
name this conic section with eccentricity one, exemplified by the equation y equals x squared.
ANSWER: parabola
The inversion of a cardioid with respect to its cusp is one of these curves. This curve is obtained when
using the parametrization x equals velocity times t times cosine of theta and y equals velocity times t times
sine of theta minus half gravity times t squared. That parametrization can be used for the trajectory of a
projectile. These curves have an eccentricity of one, and they are defined as a set of points equidistant from
a focus and a directrix. For 10 points, name this conic section which is the graph of a quadratic equation.
ANSWER: parabolas [or parabolae; prompt on quadratic curve]
The curvature of one of these three-dimensional shapes can be given as four divided by the quantity one
plus four u quantity squared. A symmetric section of one of these figures divides the volume of its
circumscribed cylinder into equal halves. Though the second-order mixed derivatives of this shape are zero,
its other second-order derivatives are positive. This shape has an elliptic type and a type that is generated by
the equation z equals x times y. That type, which contains a saddle point, is the hyperbolic type. This three-
dimensional shape is taken by spinning pools of liquid, which is why spinning mercury can be used as a
telescope. Name this shape that consists of all points the same distance from a plane and a point focus.
ANSWER: paraboloids
The one stated under von Neumann definition of the ordinals is expressed as an order type associated with
each well-ordering, and is named for Burali-Forti. A reparametrization of conditional probability density
functions to show the lack of invariance under transformations lies behind the one named for Borel and
Kolmogorov. The congruence of measures for subsets and unions of subsets is one of these stated by
Hausdorff, while the another one of these assumes that a set of infinities exists, and hence must be infinite,
as stated by Cantor. A ball dissected into six pieces and reassembled to form two balls identical to the
original is a statement of this type named for Banach and Tarski. FTP a set containing sets which are not
members of themselves leads to one of these named for Russell, a statement of mathematical contradiction.
ANSWER: paradoxes
In hyperbolic geometry, two figures with the "ultra" form of this property must share a perpendicular, and
two geodesics with this property with respect to a third can intersect. Given a line and a point not on the
line, Playfair's axiom states that only one figure with this property can be drawn. If two lines intersect a
third line, and the interior angles on one side sum to less than 180 degrees, the lines will not have this
property, according to Euclid's fifth postulate. For 10 points, name this term that identifies lines in a plane
that do not intersect.
ANSWER: parallel
Playfair's Postulate states that, given a point and a line, only one object with this property can be
constructed. That postulate is logically equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate, which is sometimes named
after this property. Corresponding angles are equal if the transverse line generating them intersects two lines
with this property. This property is exhibited by two lines that have the same slope but different intercepts.
For 10 points, give this property that is exhibited by any two coplanar lines that do not intersect.
ANSWER: parallelity
The only "stand-alone" member of Hilbert's axioms is grouped under this heading, and is equivalent to
Playfair's axiom. The side-splitter theorem requires that the side-splitter has this property. Two vectors are
linearly dependent if they have this property, and such vectors will have a dot product equal to the product
of their magnitudes. Spherical and harmonic geometries result if a postulate named for this property is
violated. In 3D, this property is distinct from skewness. Trapezoids have one pair of opposite sides with this
property. For 10 points, name this property of lines which never intersect.
ANSWER: parallel [or word forms; or parallel postulate]
The speedup gained by using this technique is limited by the time not using it according to Amdahl's
law. This technique can run into problems if operations are not atomic, because output becomes
non-deterministic when "race conditions" occur, requiring the use of synchronization. A common problem
to be avoided in this technique is deadlock. For 10 points, name this technique that differs from sequential
programs by allowing operations to happen simultaneously, as with multiple processors.
ANSWER: parallel computing [or multi-threaded computing; or concurrent computing; or distributed computing; or multiple core computing; or "processing" in place of "computing;" or multiple processor computing until it is read]
In hyperbolic geometry there are two forms of this geometric configuration, ultra and limiting. In Euclidean
geometry it is the degenerate conic section found by the limiting case as the focal distance goes to infinity
while the vertices remain constant of a hyperbola. This degenerate conic can also be seen as the intersection
of a plane and double cone when the vertex of the cone is moved to a point at infinity making the cone into
a cylinder. In projective geometry, this configuration cannot exist. Solutions in the coordinate plane to the
equation y squared equals one provide an algebraic description to this configuration. This configuration also
exists in the graph of an inconsistent system of two linear equations--that outcome arises when the two lines
have the same slope. Identify this relationship between two lines in the same plane that never intersect.
ANSWER: parallel lines
Playfair's axiom assumes their existence, which is not guaranteed in Riemannian geometry. Euclid's fifth
postulate is a way of proving that two objects do not have this property. The opposite sides of both a
rhombus and rectangle have this property. Two lines have this property if they are not skew and their
intersection is not a single point. Name the term that describes coplanar lines that do not intersect.
ANSWER: parallel lines
This mathematical statement has been shown to be equivalent to Playfair's axiom, Proclus-. Axiom, and the
Pythagorean theorem. Rewordings of the statement give rise to elliptic or hyperbolic geometries. If the
axiom is omitted from the others with which it usually associated, the non-Euclideam geometry can be
developed. Name this postulate of Euclid that assumes that given a point and a line not containing that
point that there exists only one line passing through the point that does not intersect the given line.
ANSWER: Parallel postulate (or Euclid's fifth postulate)
It follows from this result that any three non-colinear points lie on a circle, and that the summit angles of a
Saccheri quadrilateral are right angles. Beltrami proved its independence, and Klugel demonstrated the
flaws in 28 proofs of this statement. Equivalent to Proclus' Axiom and Playfair's Axiom, its rejection led to
Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Riemann's development of hyperbolic and elliptic non-Euclidean geometries. In
Euclid's Elements, it is the fifth postulate. For 10 points, name this true statement asserting the uniqueness
of a line that never intersects another line.
ANSWER: parallel postulate [accept Euclid's fifth postulate before mentioned; accept "axiom" for "postulate"]
This statement is equivalent to Proclus- axiom and Playfair's axiom, and it is used, often implicitly, in every
known proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. This statement is also equivalent to the Triangle Postulate, which
states that the sum of the angles of a triangle equals the sum of the angles of two right triangles. Its first use
was to prove the congruence of alternate interior and alternate exterior angles. This statement is also
equivalent to the Equidistance postulate, which describes the relationship between certain lines. Name this
statement that is true for Euclidean geometry but false for elliptic and hyperbolic geometries, which states
that given any line and any point not on the line, there exists exactly one line going through the given point
that does not intersect the given line.
ANSWER: Euclid's (or Euclidean) parallel postulate [or fifth postulate; accept statements equivalent to the second half of the last sentence before it is read]
Schopenhauer discussed various attempts to prove it and claimed it's a "synthetic proposition a priori."
Klugel's doctoral thesis sought to demonstrate flaws in 28 proofs of it, and Beltrami showed that no proof
was possible. A stronger form was developed by Playfair and Brodie that showed it was equivalent to the
Pythagorean theorem. Abandoned by Bolyai and Lobachevsky in their independent development of
hyperbolic geometry, it was also discarded in an elliptical geometry developed by Riemann. For 10 points,,
give this axiom of geometry proposed by Euclid involving non-intersecting lines.
ANSWER: parallel postulate [or Euclid's Fifth postulate]
Arthur Schopenhauer criticized attempted proofs of this statement from concepts rather than using
perception, and G.S. Klugel demonstrated how 28 attempted proofs of it were wrong. It can be
equated to Proclus' axiom, and a stronger version of it is Playfair's axiom. Described in Proposition
29, it was shown to be independent of four earlier statements of the same kind. Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and
Riemann have all developed geometries in which it doesn't hold. For 10 points, name this fifth postulate in
Euclid's Elements, which deals with lines that never intersect.
ANSWER: parallel postulate [accept Euclid's fifth postulate before read]
This shape is combined with a pyramid and a wedge to find the volume of a prismatoid, and the volume of
these shapes can be found using a scalar triple product, which combines a dot product and a cross product.
This shape can be generated by adding multiples of any three independent vectors using scalars from zero to
one. Examples of this shape include a cuboid, rhombohedron, or cube, and they are a subset of hexahedra.
Name this three-dimensional figure whose six faces are all parallelograms.
ANSWER: parallelepiped (prompt on "hexahedron")
A law named for this figure is used to illustrate vector addition. The area of this figure is the
product of two adjacent side lengths and the sine of the angle between them. The diagonals of this
polygon bisect each other, but are not necessarily perpendicular. It is the most general type of (*)
quadrilateral in which adjacent angles are supplementary and opposite angles are congruent. Rectangles
and rhombi are types of this polygon. For ten points, name this quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel
sides.
ANSWER: parallelogram
The midpoints of the sides of any quadrilateral can be connected to form this type of quadrilateral. This is
the least restrictive designation for which either diagonal of a quadrilateral splits it into two congruent
triangles and for which the diagonals bisect each other. Its area can be found from a cross product. This
shape's opposite angles are congruent, and its adjacent angles are supplementary. Name this quadrilateral,
special cases of which include a rectangleor a rhombus.
ANSWER: parallelogram
A flattened Sonobe [soh-noh-bay] unit has this shape. The midpoints of any quadrilateral can be
connected to form one of these figures. Vectors may be added using a "rule" named for this shape,
whose diagonals (*) bisect each other, but not necessarily perpendicularly. If one of these shapes is
inscribed in a circle, it must be a rectangle. Congruent opposite angles, and supplementary adjacent angles
are found in, for 10 points, what quadrilateral whose opposite sides are congruent and parallel?
ANSWER: parallelogram (prompt on quadrilateral or quadrangle; do not accept or prompt on any other answer)
The area of a lattice is defined as the area of a fundamental one of these shapes. One law named for them
states that the sum of the squares of its diagonals equals the sum of the squares of its sides. Like more
specific quadrilaterals, the area of one of these shapes equals the magnitude of the cross product of two

When applied to charts, these programs can employ Earley's algorithm, and the CYK algorithm can be used
to counter the local and global ambiguity problems these programs face. They can be created by programs
such as Yacc, provided there is a valid Backus-Naur notation. When they employ a stack to push symbols

the quantity 1-n quantity cubed, which are known as hexagonal numbers. The examples found so far have

numbers which equal the sum of their proper factors.
ANSWER: perfect numbers
For any natural number n, there exists only one of these numbers that can be expressed in the form "n-cubed
plus 1". Kanold was the first to show that the amount of these numbers below a given integer n had an
asymptotic form of little-O of the square root of n. With the exception of the smallest of these, all known so
far can be written as the sum of the cubes of consecutive positive odd integers. For a Mersenne prime with
exponent p, a number of this type can be found by multiplying the Mersenne prime by 2 to the power p
minus 1, according to the Euler-Euclid conjecture. These numbers are a subset of the triangular numbers,
and all numbers of this type found so far are even. For 10 points, name these numbers, such as 496 and 6,

ANSWER: perfect numbers
With the exception of the smallest of their kind, all known examples of these can be expressed as the sum of

Mersenne primes and even types of this number, and they form a subset of the triangular numbers. Numbers
which do not fit this category are classified as deficient or abundant, and these numbers all yield 2n when
they form the argument of the divisor function. It is unknown whether any odd ones exist. 6, 28, and 496 are
the first three examples of, for 10 points, what type of number that equals the sum of its proper divisors?

These numbers can be generated by adding successive powers of two until the sum is prime and then
multiplying that prime times the last number added. That method is the only successful one ever used to find
these numbers. That method, stated by Euclid [YOO-klid], gives the relationship between these numbers
and Mersenne [mer-sen] numbers. These whole numbers, which are not superabundant or deficient, have no
known odd examples. Name these numbers that equal the sum of their proper divisors.

Cayley's theorem says that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of the group of these functions
acting on G. The group of these functions is called the symmetric group. These functions are called

a set onto itself, and those that reverse the order of a pair are known as inversions. A special type of
these that leaves no object in its (*) original place is called a derangement. For n objects, the number of
these is equal to n factorial, and unlike combinations they take the order of elements into account. Shuffling

A Hamiltonian path in the polyhedron representing these entities can be found using the Steinhaus-JohnsonTrotter algorithm. The Fisher-Yates method is used for sampling a random one of these. The pure Braid
group is the kernel of the homomorphism of the Braid group to the group of these things. Calculating a
determinant involves summing products of matrix elements over all possible ones of these. Cayley's
theorem states that a group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on G, which is
itself a set of these. The sign of the Levi-Civita symbol determines whether these things are odd or even,
and they can be decomposed into transpositions. For a set of size n, there exist n factorial of, for 10 points,

ANSWER: permutations [prompt on "orderings"]
Groups formed by this sort of operation are subgroups of symmetric groups, notable examples of
which include Sylow subgroups. For any finite group, there is a group of this type to which it is
isomorphic according to Cayley's Theorem. Cycle notation is often used to denote these operations
that map a set to itself, examples of which include (*) shuffles. This operation is also often used to refer
to the quantity n!/(n-r)! which is the number of different ways to select r items from a group of n items. For
10 point, name this selection in which order matters, unlike combinations.

The Shapley-Shubik index is computed by counting these objects in which each voter is pivotal. These
objects are the elements of finite symmetric groups. One of these functions which is equal to its own inverse

correspondence from a set to itself. The number of these objects involving k elements from an n element set
is computed as n factorial divided by n minus k factorial. For ten points, identify this combinatorial function
which counts the ways to select k objects from n in which order matters, contrasted with combinations.

ANSWER: plane (accept word forms like planarity)
The path integral in Green's theorem is confined to one of these surfaces, but the path integral in
Stokes- theorem is not. Two lines are classified as skew if they are not contained by one of these
surfaces. The intersection of two of these surfaces forms a dihedral angle, and if two distinct examples
of these surfaces intersect, the intersection is a line. In coordinate geometry, the equation of one of
these surfaces often uses its normal vector. In space, this surface can represent the set of points
equidistant from two points. The geometry of two dimensions is often named for this surface. Name
this flat infinite surface.
ANSWER: planes [prompt on 2D surface(s) or two-dimensional surface(s)]
One classification of graphs depends on whether or not their edges cross when they are drawn on this
surface. A twisted sphere can also be referred to as the projective type of this shape, which includes a line at
infinity. These can be determined by a point and a normal vector, and they can also be determined by three
points that are not collinear [koe-LIN-ee-ur]. Unless two of these are parallel, their intersection is a line.
Name this shape, able to define a two-dimensional space, which is flat and infinite.
ANSWER: plane or planar
A related set of these kinds of objects named after Kepler and Poinsot exist but differ from this set since
they are not convex. The Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schlafli extended this set to higher dimensions and
in the process found a 24-cell variety, which has no three-dimensional analogue and are known as
polytopes. In nature, the herpes virus is shaped like the 20-sided member of this set of three-dimensional
objects. Including members like the Cube and the Dodecahedron, for 10 points, name this set of five regular
convex polyhedra named after a Greek philosopher.
ANSWER: Platonic Solids
An adiabatic invariant is an approximation to a more fundamental type of invariant named for this person.
An isomorphism exists between the Klein-Beltrami model and his namesake hyperbolic disk. His
eponymous transformation is known as an inhomogeneous Lorentz transformation, while his namesake
group consists of linear isometries of Minkowski space. Grigori Perelman may have recently proved, for 10
points, what Frenchman's namesake conjecture, which states that every simply connected closed threemanifold is homeomorphic to the three-sphere.
ANSWER: Henri Poincare
Because he further developed a method started by Anders Lindstedt to find the recurrence time it takes
certain systems to return to a previous state, that time is now named for this person. That time often is
relevant to his namesake maps, which are used to trace paths of particles in space. This mathematician's
namesake metric is used to place objects on his disk model of hyperbolic geometry. His namesake
conjecture is solved as a consequence of Thurston's geometrization conjecture and states that the threesphere is essentially the only closed, simply connected three-dimensional manifold. Name this French
mathematician whose conjecture was recently proven by Grigori Perelman, who was offered but turned
down the Clay Millennium Prize.
ANSWER: (Jules) Henri Poincare [pwan-kar-ay]
Along with Anders Lindstedt, this person is the namesake of a method to approximate periodic solutions to
certain differential equations. This mathematician is the namesake of first recurrence maps used to trace
paths in chaos theory, and he developed a disk model of hyperbolic geometry. This mathematician
conjectured what became a specific case of Thurston's geometrization conjecture: that the three-sphere is
the only type of bounded three-dimensional space that contains no holes. Name this mathematician whose
conjecture was proven by Grigori Perelman and was one of the Millennium Prize Problems.
ANSWER: Henri Poincare (poyn-kar-ay)
With Anders Lindstedt, this man names a technique for looking for regular perturbation expansions
to approximate periodic solutions to differential equations. His name is sometimes given to an
inhomogenous group and transformation more commonly named for Lorentz. A fixed, regular and
periodic orbit was proven to converge to a periodic orbit or a fixed point in a theorem named for this
man and (*) Bendixson. His namesake Lemma can be used to demonstrate that closed forms represent a
cohomology class, and a dodecahedral space is sometimes named for this man. This pioneer of chaos theory
is most famous for postulating a Millennium Problem solved by Grigori Perelman. For 10 points, name this
French mathematician who posited a namesake conjecture regarding three dimensional manifolds.
ANSWER: (Jules) Henri Poincare
John Stallings's "engulfing" method was used to solve one problem named for this man using
the notion of PL-homotopy. A problem named for this mathematician was introduced in the
same paper that showed that a certain object had a fundamental group of over 120. Michael
Freedman solved a special case of a generalized version of that problem named for this man,
which was solved for dimension higher than four by Stephen Smale. Richard Hamilton outlined
a method of using Ricci flows to solve that problem named for this man. For 10 points, name this
French mathematician who names a conjecture proven by Grigori Perelman which states that
every closed, simply connected manifold is homeomorphic to the three-sphere.
ANSWER: Henri Poincare
One attempt to prove it by Richard Hamilton utilizes the Ricci flow, the solutions to the differential
equation dg/dt = -2R for every point i and j. The Stallings-Zeeman theorem is a proof of the generalized
version of this statement for n >= 7. The Smale theorem showed that it applied to n >=5 and the Freedman
theorem further generalized it to the case n=4. It states that if a three-dimensional manifold has the property
that every simple closed curve can be continuously deformed to a point, then the three-dimensional
manifold is a sphere. For 10 points, name this topological problem solved by Grigori Perelman, the only
Millennium Prize problem with a verified solution.
ANSWER: Poincare Conjecture
Its generalized version can in general be realized as a result of the h-cobordism theorem, but, as Milnor's
exotic sphere demonstrates, it only applies to piecewise linear and topological manifolds in these cases. For
three-manifolds, the proof follows from the categorization given by Thurston geometrization. This proof
was recently finished when the finite time extinction of the Ricci flow was established. FTP, name this
recently resolved problem in mathematics which states that every simply connected three-manifold is a
sphere.
ANSWER: Poincare conjecture
It is a special case of the Thurston elliptization conjecture and Whitehead developed his namesake
prime link while trying to prove this statement. A proof for it involving the use of (*) k-handles was
developed by Smale and the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant was central to Freedmen's Fields medal winning
proof for the n equals 4 case. For 10 points, name this conjecture, which states that a compact n-manifold is
equivalent to the n-sphere if it has the same homotopy groups.
ANSWER: Poincare conjecture
The proof of one subset of cases of this theorem relies on the Stallings-Zeeman theorem, while another
special case of this statement is proved by Freedman's theorem. The Whitehead link was found to be a
counterexample to an incorrect proof of this theorem, while the Gluck twist might be a counterexample to
the 4-dimensional smooth verison of it, which remains an unsolved problem. A special case of Thurston's
geometrization conjecture, Richard Hamilton discovered the Ricci flow process used to prove this
statement. For ten points, identify this conjecture proved in 2003 by Grigori Perelman, which states taht any
simply connected and closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere.
ANSWER: Poincare conjecture
The Rego-Rourke and Rubenstein-Thompson algorithms attempted to disprove it, and John Stallings once
wrote a paper on "How Not to Solve" this problem. The method eventually used to solve it was introduced
by Richard Hamilton in 1982, but it was not until a series of papers written in 2002 and 2003 applied Ricci
Flow with "surgery" that it was considered provable to say that the namesake relationship existed between a
simply close connected 3-manifold and the three-sphere. For 10 points, name this Millenium Problem, a
conjecture named for a French mathematician, whose solution led to the declining of the 2006 Fields Medal
by Grigory Perelman.
ANSWER: The Poincare Conjecture
John von Neumann [NOY-mun] developed a topology without any of these entities, which usually
represent an element of a space. These entities are the only primitive objects in Tarski's axiomization
of geometry, which is in contrast to the use of lines, planes, and these objects as the three primitive
objects in Hilbert's system. Playfair's axiom assumes the existence of a line and one of these entities.
In Euclid's first postulate, two of these objects are joined to form a segment. A line called a directrix
and one of these entities called a focus can be used to define conic sections. Three of these entities
that are not on the same line define a plane, and any two of them define a line. Name these things
that have no area or volume.
ANSWER: points
One specialized form of these entities defined over linear data structures is an iterator. The use of postfix
iteration on iterators and other versions of these objects relies on the convention that adding an integer to
one of these is equivalent to adding the size of the associated type to its value; that convention is the
namesake arithmetic of these objects. C-like languages define arrays as a series of these without gaps. The
most basic operation on one of objects returns the value of the object to which it of these is associated; that
operation is dereferencing. These objects usually hold representations memory locations and that generally
indicate where an associated object is stored. For 10 points, name these objects, the "links" in conventional
implementations of linked lists.
ANSWER: pointers
This type of variable is returned by the C function malloc. They can cause programs to crash when they
are "wild" or "dangling". In C, linked lists are linked using these variables. The indexing of arrays is done
using these variable's namesake arithmetic. In C, these variables can be dereferenced using the asterisk
operator. Their void type can refer to objects of any type. For 10 points, name these variables that reference
the address of a function or variable in memory.
ANSWER: pointers
A "wild" one is one that has not been given a specific value. Its functionality can be duplicated with a onedimensional array. When one is "double indirect," it means there are two of these before the actual data can
be found. They are crucial in the creation of linked lists. Arithmetic with them involves moving up and
down a number of bytes depending on the data type being referenced. For 10 points, name this type of
variable whose value is a memory address.
ANSWER: pointer variable
Attempting to use a null one of these things can cause a segmentation fault. The function malloc
returns one of these things. Every node but the last one in a linked list contains a field for this thing.
In C and C++, these things are declared by using an asterisk and Java has references instead of these
things. The namesake (*) arithmetic of these things is used to index arrays. For 10 points, identify these
whose value is an address in memory.
ANSWER: pointers [prompt on reference]
Data serialization and restoring serialized data requires these objects to be "swizzled" and "unswizzled."
Nonstatic methods implement one of these called "this." Each node of a doubly linked list includes two of
these, often called "next" and "previous;" the head and tail nodes have one each of these set to NULL.
These objects are "dereferenced" to obtain the value at the address they indicate. For 10 points, name these
variables present in many programming languages, notably C and C++, that store a memory address.
ANSWER: pointers
Donald Knuth said that he "consider[ed] assignment statements and" these "variables to be among computer
science's most valuable treasures". Due to a namesake arithmetic, adding 1 to this kind of variable usually
results in a larger increase. Instead of objects, Java passes a corresponding one of these. In C, these are
dereferenced with an asterisk and an ampersand is used to assign them values. These variables are
dangerous if they are dangling or null; the latter case results in an exception. FTP, name this type of
variable which stores memory locations.
ANSWER: pointer
The "hazard" type allows memory allocated to nodes of lock-free dynamic shared objects to be
reclaimed, while "wild" ones have not yet been initialized. These entities, simpler implementations of
the reference date type, are necessary to (*) implement and control lists, queues, and trees. For high level
programming languages, they effectively take the place of purpose register. For ten points, name this data
type whose value directly refers to another value stored elsewhere in the computer memory.
ANSWER: Pointer
These objects are replaced during serialization in a process called unswizzling. Automatic garbage
collection is one feature of the smart type, although segmentation faults or general protection faults can be
the result of the dangling type. Each node of a doubly linked list contains has a forward and backward one,
and an asterisk is used to dereference them. For 10 points, name these variables that store memory
addresses.
ANSWER: pointers
The C++ Boost library contains "smart" types of these objects that work properly with
exceptions, as well as an "intrusive" example that includes an embedded reference count. A dispatch
table contains an array of these objects. When two or more of these entities have the same value,
aliasing occurs. During serialization of data for storage, these objects are (*) de-swizzled. Garbage
collection is used to free up ones that are no longer used, since those examples can cause segmentation
faults. Dynamic memory allocation uses these to store addresses. In Java, accessing nonexistent objects
throws an exception named for the null type of these. For 10 points, name these data types used to refer to
memory addresses.
ANSWER: pointer
In one recent programming language edition, these pieces of data can be weak, shared, or unique.
PRAM parallel algorithms often simplify algorithms by using a jumping technique named for these
entities. These entities are called (*) "wild" when they have not been properly initialized. Arithmetic on
these entities can be used to access different indeces of an array. These objects are returned after successful
calls to the malloc function. In C, these objects can be created by using the ampersand operator to get the
address of another variable. When these entities refer to objects that have been deallocated, they-re called
dangling. For 10 points, name these entities, often deferenced with an asterisk, that stores references to
objects in memory.
ANSWER: Pointers [prompt on "address"]
"Tombstones" and the lock-and-key method can be used to avoid errors caused by these objects. During
deserialization, data elements can be converted to them in a process called "swizzling." "Smart" ones make
garbage collecting easier by using methods like reference counting, while segmentation faults are often
caused by "wild" or "dangling" ones. Accessing the value held in these objects is known as "dereferencing"
them. In C and C++, they are denoted by an asterisk. For 10 points, name these data structures which hold
memory addresses.
ANSWER: pointers
In the stack class that is part of the STL, the operation top returns one of these data types. In many
languages, such as C, the array data type is actually one of these objects, due to the way arrays are laid out
in memory. During deserialization, it is common to swizzle these things into objects. The void type of them
can be used for any other data type, which is useful for multi-threading. In a doubly linked list, there are at
least two types of these objects for every node, a singly linked list has at least one. These structures can be
dereferenced to access to what they refer. For 10 points, identify these data types whose name reflects that
they refer to another object's memory location.
ANSWER: pointers or references until mentioned
Prefetching in LDS can be accomplished using the jump type of these objects. A dispatch table consists of
function ones. C allows arithmetic with these objects, which are used for the internal representation of
arrays. When objects in memory are deallocated, these can dangle. A segmentation fault arises when these
objects do not correspond to a valid location. Each node in a linked list contains two of these data types,
one of which can be dereferenced to return the next node. References are safer ways to handle some of the
functionality of these objects. For 10 point, name this type of variable which stores a memory address of
another variable.
ANSWER: pointers
A sequence can be related to a Newton series appearing in the Mellin transform of this man's namesake
generating function using the cycle named for this man, Mellin and Newton. Solvation effects can be
analyzed using an equation named for him and Boltzmann, while an equation named only for him is an
inhomogeneous version of the Laplace equation. The Jacobi identity is one of the relations satisfied by his
namesake bracket, and Fresnel's wave theory predicts his namesake spot. The lateral strain over the axial
strain gives the ratio named for, FTP, this Frenchman whose distribution has mean equal to its variance and
gives the probability of a certain number of independent events in a fixed period of time in terms of the
average rate.
ANSWER: Simeon-Denis Poisson
Together with Mellin and Newton, this scientist gives his name to a cycle that relates the Norlund-Rice
integral to the Mellin transform. His spot is sometimes called the Arago spot and appears at the center of a
circular screen, while Gouy-Chapman theory provides a solution to the equation named for him and
Boltzmann, which models salvation and describes electrostatic interactions in ionic solutions. The
dimensionless quantity of lateral strain over axial strain is known as his ratio. For 10 points, name this
French scientist whose name also adorns a distribution governed by a single parameter, lambda, used to
predict the occurrence of a number of events.
ANSWER: Simeon Poisson
The degrees of nodes in a large Erdos-Renyi graph are approximated by this construct. Raikov's
theorem states that if the sum of two independent random variables has this function, then both
random variables are also distributed as such. When randomly throwing (*) balls into bins, it gives a
good approximation of the number of balls in a given bin. This distribution is used for counting arrivals in
queuing when the number of arrivals in time intervals is independent and depends only on interval length,
and thus is well-modeled by its namesake process. It is the limit of the binomial distribution as the number
of events increases and the probability decreases so their product is constant. For 10 points, name this
distribution frequently used to model rare events.
ANSWER: Poisson Distribution
This distribution's moment-generating function is e raised to the product of m and quantity e to the x minus
one, where m is its mean. One application of this distribution is to a construct requiring both independent
increment and stationary increment assumptions. A related function based on the difference of variables
following this distribution is named for Skellam and is useful in describing differences in the photon noise
of two images. Fluctuation in one of its parameters is called shot noise, and its parameter denoted lambda
describes both its mean and variance. Useful in modeling copy errors and waiting times, for 10 points,
identify this distribution named after the Frenchman who introduced it.
ANSWER: Poisson distribution [or Poissonian; or von Bortkiewicz distribution early]
Dobinski's formula implies that its nth moment is given by the partitions of a set of size n when it has an
expected value of 1. The difference between two of these with different variables and parameters is given
by a function named for J.G. Skellam. This function's mean and variance are the parameter itself, which is
the product of the number of events times the expectation value, and is represented by lambda. Often used
to model the probability of rare events, for 10 points, identify this probability function, which gives the
expected probability of that event occurring within a certain time period and is named for a French
mathematician.
ANSWER: Poisson Distribution
The Anscombe transformation is used in systems which follow this distribution, and variables that follow
this distribution are subject to Robbins Lemma. When it has an expected value of 1, the nth moment of this
distribution is equal to the number of partitions of a set of n elements. If two variables follow it, their
difference follows the Skellam distribution. Used to model the number of mutations in irradiated DNA or
the number of calls to a call center, this limiting case of the binomial distribution is entirely reliant on the
parameter lambda, which is equal to its mean and variance. Usually used to model events with low
probability, FTP, name this statistical distribution named for a Frenchman.
ANSWER: Poisson distribution
This mathematical concept was discussed at length in Ladislaus Bortkiewicz's book, The Law of Small
Numbers, which used Prussian military data about deaths from horse-kicks to illustrate this concept. This
concept can be calculated by taking lambda, which symbolizes the expected number of occurrences, to the k
value, which symbolizes the number of occurrences, multiplied by e to the negative lambda all divided by k
factorial. For 10 points, name this mathematical distribution, governed by a single parameter, lambda,
which models the number of unlikely events within a given time interval.
ANSWER: Poisson distribution
The non-linear Anscombe transform on this type of variable sets the variance of it to 1, and Dobinski's
formula demonstrates that nth Bell number is the nth moment of this distribution. With PDF proportional
to its characteristic value to the k over k factorial, the difference between two variables with this distribution
follows the Skellam distribution, and it can be considered a limiting case of the binomial distribution. It has
both mean and variance lambda, and von Bortkiewicz used it to model deaths by horse kick in the Prussian
army, illustrating his proposed Law of Small Numbers. For 10 points, identify this probability distribution,
used to model the number of low-probability events that occur in a specific time period.
ANSWER: Poisson Distribution
When data shows over- or underdispersion with respect to this distribution, a modification named
for Conway and Maxwell is used. The Robbins Lemma is used to relate expected values from this
distribution. The difference between two variables that follow it is given by the Skellam distribution,
and its nth moment is equal to the number of partitions of a set of size n. Used to model chemical DNA
mutagenesis, calls to a call center, or horse-kicks in the Prussian army, it contains a single parameter
lambda which is both its mean and variance. For 10 points, name this distribution used to model rare events,
named for a Frenchman.
ANSWER: Poisson distribution
Inter-event times for this distribution follow the exponential distribution, and its moment-generating
function is proportional to e to the t, quantity minus one. The sum of variables with this distribution itself
follows this distribution; that result is its reproductive property. This distribution applies when the question
of how many events have not occurred has no meaning, and when the product of the number of trials with
the probability remains fixed as the number of trials goes to infinity, it approximates the binomial
distribution; that approximation is good for many trials with small probability of success. Its mean and
variance are both equal to its single parameter, and its mass function at x for a parameter mu is e to the
minus mu times mu to the x, over x factorial. Name this distribution used to model waiting times for
arrivals, named for a Frenchman.
ANSWER: Poisson distribution [accept Poisson processes]
This type of model can be generalized through Cinlar's inversion method or by thinning. It's not Brownian
motion, but these systems have the predictable representation property. The probability of finding two
events separated by a given time in these systems is exponentially distributed and like other systems in its
class it posses independent increments. This is a simple example of a Levy process where each jump
increments the count by one. This memoryless counting process starts at zero and the number of events n in
any length of time t is equal to e to the negative lambda t times lambda t raised to the n over n factorial.
These processes are used to describe the arrival of customers to a store or a queue. For 10 points, name
these processes that are governed a distribution of the same name where events are independent but happen
at an average rate lambda.
ANSWER: Poisson process [prompt on Levy process; prompt on exponential process]
Euler's ("oilers") formula can be used to represent complex numbers in this system. Using the
semi-latus rectum and the eccentricity as constants, conic sections can be represented directly in this
system. One coordinate in this system can be found by taking the square root of the sum of squares of the x
and y terms. Lemniscates (LEM-niss-kates) and cardioids (CAR-dee-oydz) can be represented in this
system, which uses r and theta as variables. For 10 points, name this 2D coordinate system where each
point is determined by a distance and angle.
ANSWER: polar coordinates
Fermat primes are involved in the constructibility of one type of these figures with a compass and
straight edge. These figures are convex if they have no reflex angle. The formula "n minus two times 180
all divided by n" can be used to calculate the interior angle of one type. The faces of Platonic solids consist
of "regular" ones of these figures, which means that all their angles and sides are equal. For 10 points,
identify these two-dimensional closed shapes made of straight lines.
ANSWER: polygon [or n-gon]
Polar reciprocation yields the dual of one of these. Stellation is most commonly performed on these
things. The Euler characteristic is two for the convex type of these things. There are only five examples of
these that have congruent, regular polygons for faces and have the same number of faces meeting at each
vertex; those are the Platonic solids. For 10 points, identify this term for three-dimensional solids.
ANSWER: polyhedra [or polyhedron]
If one half plus micron plus mu is an integer, then the Gegenbauer differential equation will have a
solution involving the ultraspherical form of these objects. The ones named for Schur are a special
variety of the ones named for Jack, and those named for Stirling and Friedrich Bessel form the
Sheffer Sequence. Murphy's formula can be used to represent ones generated from Gram-Schmit
orthonormalization and named for (*) Legendre. An infinite sequence of these entities bears the label of
orthogonal, while Abel's Impossibility theorem involves the severing of these that have an order higher than
five. FTP, name these mathematical expressions that do not contain numerical exponents or division by a
variable and comprise more than one term, such as x squared plus two x plus three.
ANSWER: polynomials (accept orthogonal polynomials until "Schur")
Every finitely generated projective module of a ring of these objects is free, according to the Quillen-Suslin
theorem. Classically, an algebraic variety consists of a set of solutions to a system of these functions.
Computation over these objects is simplified by the use of Grobner bases. Concatenating multiple instances
of these functions together piecewise yields a spline, which is used for interpolation. The eigenvalues of a
matrix are equal to the roots of one of these, called the "characteristic" one. A truncated Taylor series is one
of these functions, and quotients of them are called rational functions. For 10 points, name these functions
that consist of sums of variables multiplied by coefficients and raised to integer exponents, an example of
which is "x squared plus two".
ANSWER: polynomials [or polynomial functions]
Ones named for Hermite are solution to the quantum harmonic oscillator and are orthogonal, with e
to the negative x squared as their weight function. The eigenvalues of a 2 by 2 matrix can be calculated
using their trace and determinant. according to a theorem named for Samuelson. A theorem named for
Abel and Ruffini states that there is no closed form expression for the roots of one with degree five or
above. For 10 points, identify these quantities which are functions of a variable x raised to the nth
power, exemplified by ax squared plus bx.
ANSWER: polynomials
The determinant of a Vandermonde matrix is usually called one of these things. Power sums are
related to "symmetric" varieties of these things by the Newton identities. The solutions of these
things can be quickly tested with Horner's method. The elementary symmetric function for these
things are defined by Vieta's formulas. Their types of solutions can be determined by using (*)
Descartes's rule of signs. A complex solution to these functions always exists according to the fundamental
theorem of algebra. Their degree is equal to their number of roots. For 10 points, name these functions that
consist of a sum of variables raised to non-negative integer powers and multiplied by coefficients, such as
cubics and quadratics.
ANSWER: polynomials [prompt on functions until it is read]
The monic [MONE-ik] type of these is addressed by Gauss- Lemma, and Alexander and Jones types of
these are used to distinguish types of knots. Lagrange [lah-GRAHNJ] interpolation is used to create one of
these that passes through n specified points, and graphs of these must follow Descartes- [day-karts] Rule of
Signs. In simple cases, these can be divided using synthetic division, and they can otherwise, like numbers,
be divided by long division. Their degree is calculated by taking the largest of the sums of the variable
exponents of each term, and their variables- exponents must be whole numbers. Name these expressions,
examples of which include binomials and trinomials.
ANSWER: polynomials
These entities can be used to arbitrarily closely approximate a continuous function on a closed interval
according to the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. These functions intersect at knots in splines, which are
constructed piecewise from them for purposes of interpolation. A method named for Cardano
demonstrates how to find the solutions to one subclass of this family of functions, and Abel and Ruffini
proved there was no general solution to them when their degree was greater than four. For 10 points,
name these functions which consist of a sum of coefficients times powers of a variable, such as "x-cubed
plus two-x-squared minus one."
ANSWER: polynomials
One set of these objects is orthogonal with respect to a Gaussian weighting function, and another is used
to solve Laplace's (luh-PLAH-sez) equation in spherical coordinates; those sets of these objects are named
for Hermite (er-MEET) and Legendre (luh-ZHAN-druh). Writing a Taylor series attempts to approximate a
differentiable function as one of these objects. One of these is guaranteed to have a number of roots equal to
its degree by the fundamental theorem of algebra. For 10 points, name these functions of a variable and its
powers, such as x squared plus two x plus one.
ANSWER: polynomials
If a ring R is Noetherian, then the ring of these objects over R is also Noetherian according to the
Hilbert basis theorem. Given a set of these objects S, the set of values which make every element of S
vanish is an affine variety. For a ring or a field denoted K, the ring of these objects over the ring or
field is denoted K followed by x enclosed in brackets. A monic one of these objects whose roots are
the eigenvalues of a matrix is the matrix's (*) "characteristic" one. Descartes- rule of signs applies to
equations of these objects. Techniques for solving equations of these functions degree 2 include completing
the square, factoring, and using the quadratic formula. For 10 points each, name these functions consisting
of variables multiplied by coefficients and raised to integer exponents, such as "x squared minus four."
ANSWER: polynomials
The Legendre variety of these mathematical objects appears when solving Laplace's
equation, and eigenvalues can be identified via the characteristic variety of these objects.
Those that contain an infinite number of terms are known as a power series, and a fraction of
two of them is known as a rational function. Although there is no general formula to solve
quintic ones, those of smaller degree can always be solved for x via the quartic, cubic, and
quadratic equations. For 10 points, name these functions, a sum of terms with constants
multiplied by powers of x.
ANSWER: polynomial functions [or polynomials; prompt on function]
One of these objects used in knot theory is named HOMFLY [pronounced "homefly"]. This type of function
can be evaluated using Horner's method. These functions form a ring, since they can be added and
multiplied but not always divided. The quotient of two of these functions can be simplifed using the method
of partial fractions and is called a rational function. Synthetic division can be used to find the roots of this
type of function, and the number of roots is at most its degree. Formed as a sum of coefficients times non-
negative powers of x, for ten points, identify these mathematical functions exemplified by x^3 - x and x^2 + 1.
ANSWER: polynomials
The Weierstrauss approximation theorem states that any continuous function can be written in terms of
these to any accuracy, and the eigenvalues of a quantum harmonic oscillator arise from the Hermite types of
these. The fundamental theorem of algebra states that these have the same number of complex roots as their
degree, while the rule of signs can determine the number of positive roots of these. For 10 points, identify
these types of functions which are written as variables raised to non-negative integer powers, examples of
which are the quintic "y equals x to the fifth" and the quadratic "y equals x-squared plus two x".
ANSWER: polynomials
In graph theory, the "chromatic" one of these objects determines how many colors a vertex graph
can have, and the "Legendre" type are orthogonal in the integral inner product space from -1 to 1.
Though they aren-t series, the Taylor [*] type of these can be used in approximations. According to the
Abel-Ruffini theorem, there is no general solution to these of degree 5 or higher. Synthetic division can
factor, for 10 points, what mathematical objects with positive integer exponents, exemplified by 'x to the
fifth plus two- and 'x cubed plus x-?
ANSWER: Polynomials
Most computer programs use Homer's rule to evaluate expressions of this form. Varieties, the central object
of study in algebraic geometry, are defined to be the set of solutions to a system of these objects. One type
of these named after Vaughan Jones and another named after James Alexander and John Conway are used
to represent knots. Descartes- rule of signs is a method for determining the number of roots for one these,
and these can be differentiated using the power and sum rules. Niels Abel (AH-bul) proved that formulas do
not exist to find roots for these when they are at least fifth degree after Lodovico Ferrari and Gerolamo
Cardano found a formula for the quartic type. Give the name for these expressions, examples of which are
3xy and x+2y.
ANSWER: polynomials [or polynomial expressions; accept polynomial equations]
Hilbert's basis theorem states that certain rings of these objects are Noetherian, and Eisenstein's criterion
tests for their irreducibility over the rationals. The Abel-Ruffini theorem states the impossibility of a
solution in radicals for some of these expressions. Descartes- Rule of Signs can be used to find the number
of positive, negative, and complex solutions to one of these, and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
states that they have a number of roots equal to their degree. They are infinitely differentiable and cross the
x-axis at their roots. For 10 points, name these expressions composed of variables and their powers, written
as sums of monomials.
ANSWER: polynomials
All rings of these objects over countable fields are finitely generated, according to Hilbert's basis theorem.
Horner's rule is a method of evaluating these objects, and Eisenstein's criterion gives the condition for them
to be irreducible. Abel's impossibility theorem states these objects of degree five are incapable of algebraic
solutions. Descartes [dey-KART] is the namesake of a rule that relates their number of positive roots to the
number of changes of sign of their coefficients. For 10 points, name these mathematical expressions
exemplified by x squared plus four x minus six.
ANSWER: polynomials
The Hilbert Basis Theorem concerns rings of these constructs. A function of this type can approximate any
other continuous function as closely as wanted by the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, and according to Abel's
Impossibility Theorem, formulas for solving those above a certain (*) degree do not exist. Descartes' Rule
of Signs can be used to determine the sign of their roots. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, their
total number of zeros is equal to the degree of their highest term. For 10 points, name this type of
expression exemplified by monomials, as well as x squared plus x plus 1.
ANSWER: polynomials
If a ring is Noetherian, this type of ring over the original is also Noetherian by the Hilbert basis theorem.
A splitting field is the smallest field extension for which a given one of these decomposes into linear
factors. The complex numbers are algebraically closed because these functions are always zero at least one
point in that field. Synthetic division is applied to these functions. No general solution exists for certain
types of these functions by Abel's impossibility theorem. Descartes' rule of signs shows how many positive
or negative roots one of these can have. For 10 points, name these functions consisting of variables raised
to integer powers.
ANSWER: polynomial [prompt on rational function]
A sufficient condition to check if one of a subset of these objects is irreducible is Eisenstein's
criterion, and Hilbert's basis theorem demonstrates that the ideals of rings of certain types of these
objects are finitely generated. The Horner scheme is a process to rapidly approximate their (*) roots,
and Abel demonstrated that closed-form roots only generally exist when these entities have degree less than
five. For 10 points, name these expressions, the sum of one or more variables and their products and
powers, such as x2 + x + 1.
ANSWER: polynomials
Every ideal of this type of ring is finitely generated according to Hilbert's basis theorem. The
multiplication of two "primitive" types of these things is itself primitive according to Gauss's lemma.
These things can be evaluated using nested multiplication or Horner's method. The Eisenstein
criterion provides a sufficient condition for these things being irreducible over the rationals. A
continuous function can be uniformly approximated on a closed interval by one of these things. Niels
Henrik Abel fully proved that there was no solution in radicals to these things when they have degree
greater than five. For 10 points, identify these things that consists of sums of coefficients multiplied by
variables raised to integer exponents.
ANSWER: polynomials
Decompositions of a type of these things are found with the Littlewood-Richardson rule; that
type is the characters of irreducible representations of general linear groups, are indexed by
partitions, and are named for Schur. A method of proving the Cayley-Hamilton theorem is
showing the minimal one of them divides another one of them. A Grobner basis is defined over
an ideal over a ring of these things. Eisenstein names a criterion that tells when these things are
irreducible. Algebraically closed fields have the property that these thingss associated with that
field can be split into linear factors, and the Abel-Ruffini theorem proved that there is no general
formula for solutions of these things of degree five or higher. For 10 points, name these functions
which consists of the sum of several terms with a variable raised to integer exponents.
ANSWER: polynomial
In base 2, these objects are designated primitive if they generate maximum period linear feedback shift
registers. The Chebyshev ones are a special case of the Jacobi ones, as are the Legendre ones. A Taylor
series of order n corresponds to one of these with degree n, and irreducible ones cannot be factored, though
the fundamental theorem of algebra guarantees they have at least one complex root. For 10 points, identify
these mathematical objects whose terms are all proportional to a power of a variable, examples of which
include 3y and x squared plus 1.
ANSWER: polynomials
Eisenstein's criterion tells if certain types of these are irreducible over the rational numbers. If they
involve only one variable, these objects will have at most n-1 ["n minus 1"] extrema and n-2 ["n
minus 2"] inflection points if they are of degree n. One over x is (*) not this type of expression, because
the exponent on the variable must be a positive integer. For 10 points, name this type of mathematical
expression, exemplified by quadratics such as x squared plus 3x minus 5.
ANSWER: polynomials (accept polynomial expressions, equations, or functions; accept polynomials with integer coefficients; prompt on expressions, equations, or functions)
In math, types of these expressions named for Chebyshev and Hermite and orthogonal. In computer science,

the quintic ones, and according to the fundamental theorem of algebra, one of these of the nth degree has n
complex roots. They are defined as consisting of one or more terms, each of which is the product of a
constant and a variable raised to an integral power. FTP name these algebraic expressions, an example of
which is x squared plus five x plus nine.
ANSWER: polynomials
Hilbert's Nullstellensatz relates algebraic sets to ideals in rings of these objects. A lemma named for
Gauss says that the product of two primitive examples of these objects is primitive and Eisenstein's
criterion concerns their reducibility. The set of these objects over a field K is denoted K bracket x
and forms their namesake ring. Their quotients can be simplified by synthetic division. Eigenvalues
correspond to the values at which a matrix's (*) characteristic one evaluates to zero. Descartes- rule of
signs bounds the number of their real roots, and another theorem says that examples of degree n has n
complex roots counting multiplicity. For 10 points, name these functions which can be written as a sum
where each term is a coefficient times some power of a variable.
ANSWER: polynomials
The Tartaglia-Cardano method is used to solve one type of these equations. Abel's Impossibility
Theorem states that no algebraic solutions exist to other types of these equations. One specific type of
these equations is solved by a namesake (*) formula that includes the discriminant, which is equal to b
squared minus four a c. Finding the solutions to these equations is equivalent to finding the roots of their
namesake functions. For 10 points, name this family of equations in which a function consisting of only
coefficients and powers of a variable is set equal to zero, examples of which include cubic and quadratic
equations.
ANSWER: polynomial equations [accept cubic equations before "Abel"; accept quartic equations before "Abel"]
A definite matrix with this property has a unique Cholesky factorization and possesses
eigenvalues which all have this property. These kinds of numbers in two's complement are expressed
with a leading zero. The signum function returns a value of one for these types of numbers. With the
exception of the discontinuity, the Heaviside function returns a value of 1 for these kinds of numbers,
which is also the domain for the non-complex natural (*) logarithm function. For these kinds of
numbers the floor function is merely the truncation function. A function that is concave upwards has a
curvature that takes on these values. For 10 points, with the exception of zero, the output of the absolute
value function are what numbers, the opposite of negative numbers?
ANSWER: positive [accept logical equivalents, such as being greater than zero]
The Karlin-Rubin theorem provides a test function which has a maximum value for this quantity
among probability density functions with the monotone likelihood ratio property. Jacob Cohen wrote
a popular book about calculating this quantity while working in the behavioral sciences. The
likelihood-ratio test has the highest value of this quantity when testing between two simple
hypotheses according to the (*) Neyman-Pearson lemma. Along with significance level, this quantity is
decreased when using the Bonferroni correction method and it is often plotted against sample size when
designing an experiment. Also known as sensitivity, this quantity is often calculated by finding the
probability of not committing a Type II ("2") error. For 10 points, name this statistical quantity defined as
the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.
ANSWER: statistical power [accept sensitivity before it is read]
For a given threshold eta, the likelihood-ratio method uniformly has the highest value of this according
to the Neyman-Pearson lemma. A decrease in this quantity is the main cost of using a non-parametric
procedure over a parametric one. This value depends on the effect size, the sample size, and the
significance criterion used. This value is equal to one minus beta, or alternately, it is the probability of not
committing a type two error. For 10 points, name this measure of the effectiveness of a statistical test,
which is the probability that it will reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.
ANSWER: statistical power
Numbers of this type are the only ones which can not be expressed as the sum of at least two
consecutive integers. Euler proved that all even perfect numbers are equal to the difference of two of
these numbers. The sum of all the entries in a row of Pascal's triangle will always be one of these
numbers. A Mersenne prime is one less than one of these numbers, which have only a single one in
their (*) binary representation. For 10 points, identify these exponentiations of the only even prime, which
include 32, 64 and 128.
ANSWER: powers of two [or obvious equivalents, such as two to the power of n]
The Erdos-Gyarfas conjecture states that a cycle of length equal to one of these numbers exists for all
graphs with minimum degree 3. The number of vertices of an n-dimensional hypercube is equal to the nth
of these numbers, and a Mersenne prime is characteristically one less than these numbers. The sum of a
row of Pascal's triangle is equal to one of these, and in binary the nth of these numbers is simply a 1
followed by n zeros. For 10 points, name these numbers, the first few of which are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32...
ANSWER: Powers of 2 or 2 to the nth power (Accept equivalents)
The proof of the Crochemore-Perrin two-way algorithm relies on a lemma about "short" examples of
these objects. In CIDR notation, the length of the network example of this entity is encoded after the slash.
The second case of the "good rule" in the Boyer-Moore-Algorithm tries to match one of these components
of the pattern to its counterpart in the target. The Huffman scheme creates a code that is said to be free of
these. The prebuilt table in the KMP algorithm contains the length of the longest examples of these that
obey certain requirements. In a different context, Polish notation is this type of notation because of the
ordering of the operator relative to the operands. For 10 points, name these substrings of a string that start
of the beginning of the string, unlike suffixes.
ANSWER: prefixes
The method for accomplishing this task using elliptic curves is named after Hendrik Lenstra, while the best
method for accomplishing this task for large numbers is the number field sieve. Another method for doing
this involves looking for results of modular arithmetic that are perfect squares, which is known as a
quadratic sieve. Euclid's Lemma can be used to prove the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states
that results of this process are unique. Name this task that writes a number as a product of whole numbers
that are not composite.
ANSWER: prime factorization [or integer factorization; or prime decomposition; accept word forms]
The most efficient classical method of performing this operation is selecting a pair of small-degree
polynomials over the rationals with a common integer root in the General Number Field Sieve. A
method of doing this which finds a cycle in a pseudo-random sequence is Pollard's rho algorithm.
Shor developed a polynomial-time algorithm for doing this on a (*) quantum computer. The ability to
perform this function quickly for large inputs would defeat RSA encryption. A simple method of
performing this operation is trial division, and this problem is somewhat more difficult than primality
testing. For 10 points, identify this operation which decomposes a number into the product of powers of
primes.
ANSWER: prime factorization [or integer factorization; accept factoring instead of "factorization"]
The Pratt certificate for this is used in the Lucas-Lehmer algorithm for testing it. The Legendre
symbol is used in the Solovay-Strassen test for this. The Miller-Rabin test for this results in many
false witnesses from Carmichael numbers. Fermat's Little Theorem gives results for taking a
modulus by a number satisfying (*) this property. A naive algorithm for testing this involves testing every
integer up to the square root of a number to see if it is a divisor of that number. For 10 points, name this
property of numbers that are only divisible by one and themselves.
ANSWER: primality [or prime number; accept equivalent word forms]
Miller's algorithm conditionally checks for this property, but Rabin modified that algorithm to make it
probabilistic, like the Fermat test. The most computationally naive way to determine if a number n has this
property is trial division which checks to see if no number less than n evenly divides it. For 10 points, name
this property possessed by non-composite numbers whose only divisors are one and the number itself.
ANSWER: primality [or prime; or primeness; or any other word forms]
This property is possessed by the constant described in Mills' theorem, and a one way of determining this
property is by the Lucas-Lehmer test. A statement about the asymptotic incidence of this property is this
property's namesake theorem, and the fact that every number can be written as the sum of two numbers
with this property is given as Goldbach's conjecture. Famously subject of a proof by Euclid showing that
there are infinitely many numbers with this property, numbers that do not have this property are called
composite. For 10 points, name this property of a number that means it is divisible only by one and itself.
ANSWER: primality [or prime]
The existence of infinitely many bounded gaps between numbers with this property was proven in an
acclaimed 2013 paper of Yitang Zhang. That result generalizes the conjecture that there exist infinitely
many pairs "n" and "n plus 2" which have this property. If every even integer greater than 2 can be written
as the sum of two numbers with this property, then Goldbach's conjecture is true. A classic method for
finding numbers with this property is the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Two numbers have this property relative to
one another if they have no nontrivial common divisors. For 10 points, name this property possessed by
numbers that are divisible only by one and themselves.
ANSWER: primality [or primeness; or word forms]
A sequence of numbers with this property contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions by the GreenTao theorem. If x is has this property and 2 x plus 1 also has this property, then the resultant values are
named for Germain. Carmichael numbers do not have this property even though they pass the Fermat test.
Goldbach's conjecture states that every even integer can be represented as the sum of two numbers with this
property. For 10 points, name these numbers whose only factors are one and themselves.
ANSWER: primality [or prime numbers; accept word forms]
Terence Tao used a Selberg sieve to show that this problem could not be solved in sublinear time. Agrawal,
Kayal, and Saxena proved that this problem can be solved in polynomial time. Algorithms to solve this
problem named for Miller-Rabin and for Lucas are both based on Fermat's Little Theorem. An early
algorithm for this problem checked if the input survived the (*) Sieve of Eratosthenes, while another
checks all numbers up to the square root of the input to see if they are divisors. Closely related to the
problem of factoring, for ten points, identify this problem which attempts to determine if a given positive
integer has only one proper factor.
ANSWER: primality testing (accept anything about determining whether a number is prime, do not accept finding primes or equivalents)
There exists a real number A such that the floor of the quantity A to the three to the n gives one of these
numbers for every positive integer n according to Mills' Theorem. Two to the quantity p minus one is
congruent to one modulo p squared is satisfied by the Weifrich type of these. The Lucas-Lehmer Test is
used to determine if a number fits a specific category of these and every even number can be written as the
sum of two of these according to Goldbach's conjecture. Euclid showed that there are infinitely many of, for
10 points, what type positive integers, with two being the smallest member, which are only divisible by one
and themselves.
ANSWER: prime numbers [accept Mills theorem until "these numbers"]
Landau's problems concern these numbers, and include Legendre's conjecture about them. A theorem
concerning the modular arithmetic of these numbers is called Fermat's little theorem. It is believed that
every even integer greater than two can be expressed as a sum of two of these numbers, a conjecture named
for Goldbach. The theorem named for this type of number states that the number of these up to x can be
approximated by the function x over the natural log of x, and these numbers remain after applying the Sieve
of Erastosthenes. This subset the of natural numbers is often contrasted with composite numbers. Name
these numbers of which two is the only even one, numbers that are divisible only by one and themselves.
ANSWER: prime numbers [or primes; accept primality]
This property is tested for by Proth's theorem, and GIMPS is searching for numbers with this
property. A theorem about this property states that the distribution of numbers with it is
approximately n over log n, and numbers with it separated by two are called "twins." Other kinds of
these numbers are named for [*] Fermat and Mersenne, and Goldbach's conjeture states that every even
integer greater than two can be written as the sum of two numbers with this property. Euler proved that
there are infinitely numbers with this property, which can be found with the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For 10
points, name this property of numbers whose only factors are one and themselves.
ANSWER: prime [or primality; accept prime numbers; accept primes]
The AKS algorithm tests to see if an entity is one of these and Wilson's theorem gives a condition for
them. Their namesake theorem states that the probability of a number being this is about one over the
natural log. They can be found using the Sieve of Eratosthenes (air-uh-TOSS-thuh-neez). Euclid proved

Goldbach's Conjecture. The Sieve of Erathosthenes [air-uh-TOSS-thuh-neez] can find, for 10 points, what
kind of number whose only divisors are itself and 1?
ANSWER: prime numbers
One way to find them is with a Sieve of Eratosthenes, and Golbach's Conjecture states that every number
greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two of these numbers. Euler proved that the sum of their
reciprocals diverges, while the fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that all natural numbers can be
uniquely factorized into them. For ten points, name these numbers divisible only by one and themselves.
ANSWER: Prime numbers
A theorem about these entities states that the number of them below x is grows as x over l-n of x.
Goldbach's Conjecture asks whether every even number can be written as a sum of two of these numbers. A
famous proof involving these numbers involves assuming there are only finitely many of them, then asking
what divides the number one greater than their product. That proof by contradiction was used by Euclid to
demonstrate their infinitude. For 10 points, identify these numbers like 11, 13, and 17, which are only
divisible by one and themselves.
ANSWER: prime numbers
A non-zero element of a ring R is one of these elements if it is not a unit, and, for any elements x and y in
R, if it divides x times y, it also divides x or y. A number n is one of these numbers if and only if "n minus
one factorial" is congruent to "negative one modulo n", according to Wilson's theorem. An integer
raised to the power of one of these numbers and that integer are congruent modulo the exponent,
according to Fermat's little theorem. When they are equal to "one less than a power of two", these
numbers are named for Mersenne. These numbers can be found using the sieve of Eratosthenes. For 10
points, name these numbers divisible only by themselves and one.
ANSWER: prime numbers [or prime elements]
Tests for identifying these include the Miller-Rabin test and the AKS test, and they can also be
found using the sieve of Eratosthenes (air-a-TOSS-the-nees). The Riemann (REE-mawn) hypothesis
has implications regarding their distribution. According to (*) Goldbach's conjecture, any even number
greater than two is the sum of two of them. Euclid famously proved that there are an infinite number of
them. For 10 points, name these numbers which are divisible only by one and themselves.
ANSWER: prime numbers
These numbers are the subject of the bounded gap theorem proved by Tom Zhang in 2013. Their
spaces are darkened when drawing an Ulam spiral, which demonstrates that several quadratics with
a leading coefficient of four generate several of these numbers. Pairs of these numbers are added
in Goldbach's conjecture, and pairs that differ by two are called twins. Unique products of these
numbers are the basis of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Name these numbers left by the
Sieve of Eratosthenes that are not composite, meaning that their only factors are one and themselves.
ANSWER: prime numbers or primes [accept twin primes]
Eight of the nine Heegner numbers have this property, and numbers with this property are produced
by a polynomial named for Euler of the form n squared plus n plus 41. The Ulam spiral shows
diagonal patterns of these. The Goldbach conjecture states that every integer greater than two is the
sum of two of these, and the (*) Mersenne variety of these take the form 2 to the n minus one. Euclid
demonstrated that an infinite number of them exist. By marking all multiples of different integers, the Sieve

ANSWER: prime numbers
The AKS and Miller-Rabin tests are used to find these numbers. In the asymptotic limit, the
number of them less than a given number x is approximately equal to x divided by the natural
logarithm of x. Goldbach's conjecture states that every even number can be written as the (*) sum of
two of these. Euclid showed that there are an infinite number of them, and a type that is one less than a

A specific type of these entities x obey a relation in which x squared divides the x minus Legendre symbol x
over fifth Fibonacci number. Another type satisfies the conditions of Wolstonholme's theorem for the fourth
power, though all of them satisfy that result for the third power. If x is one of these and 2x plus 1 is also,
they are named for Germain. In addition to the Wall-Sun-Sun ones, these numbers divide themselves minus
one factorial plus one according to Wilson's theorem. Their count is asymptotic to x over the natural log of

Fermat and Mersenne give their names to varieties of, for 10 points, what kind of number whose only
factors are one and itself?
ANSWER: prime numbers
The Ulam Spiral is used to visually represent patterns in these numbers. The polynomial n squared minus n
plus forty-one outputs these numbers for the first forty positive integer inputs. When n is this type of
number, one less than the factorial of n minus one is divisible by n according to Wilson's Theorem, and
a to the n power minus a is divisible by n by Fermat's Little Theorem. Euclid supposed that there were
finitely many of these numbers and then multiplied them all and added one to demonstrate their infinitude.

ANSWER: prime numbers or primes
If there were a solution to the equation x to the n plus y to the n plus z to the n equals zero, it
would be an example of the Wall-Sun-Sun type of these numbers. An elementary proof that the
quantity of these numbers less than x divided by x over log x is equal to one was provided by Paul
Erdos and Alte Selberg. In 2013, Yitan Zhang found that the number of pairs of this type of number

Fermat's [fehr-mahs] little theorem uses this type of number as a modulus. When one more than twice one
of these numbers shares their property, then they are classified as the Germain type, and raising two to the
power of one of these numbers and subtracting one gives a Mersenne number. When these numbers differ

these numbers which are only divisible by one and themselves, often contrasted with composite numbers.
ANSWER: prime numbers
If you multiply two of these values and find the Euler totient function of the product, you can create public
and private keys symbolized d and e. Whether a given number is one of these values is tested using an
algorithm named for Miller and Rabin. One naive test for these values, named for Fermat, gives false

Euclid's lemma, while the fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every natural number has a unique
factorization into these. For 10 points, name these numbers that have exactly two positive divisors.
ANSWER: prime numbers
For an integer input, the totient function gives the number of integers that are "co"-this. When Gauss

When properly optimized, the Sieve of Atkins is a modern method for finding them that is faster than
the ancient Sieve of Eratosthenes. There are infinitely many of them, and the Riemann hypothesis
and Goldbach conjecture speculate on their distribution and the expression on integers as pairs of
them, respectively. Really large ones factor into the RSA encryption method commonly used for secure
internet transactions while special ones identified by Mersenne are equal to one less than 2 raised to certain
powers. 2 is the only even example of, for 10 points each, what numbers whose factors consist only of 1 and
themselves?
ANSWER: Prime numbers
Its namesake counting function, pi of n, is approximately given by n over the natural logarithm of n. 1024
bit versions of these are used in Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and its distribution is linked to the zeros of
the Riemann zeta function. The sieve of Erastosthenes is used to find small ones of these, and there are 47
known Mersenne ones of these. Goldbach's conjecture states that all even integers greater than 2 can be
expressed as sum of two of these numbers. For 10 points, identify these numbers that can be used to factor
larger numbers and have no divisors other than 1 and itself.
ANSWER: prime numbers
n has this property if and only if the Euler phi function evaluated on n equals n-minus-one. Bertrand's
postulate and Goldbach's conjecture concern the existence of these objects, whose Mersenne examples
are always one less than a power of two. They can be detected via the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and every
integer can be written as a product of them via the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. For 10 points,
name these integers that are only divisible by themselves and one.
ANSWER: prime numbers
This word prefixed by "pseudo" describes n to a base a if a to the n-1 power and 1 are congruent modulo n.
Carmichael numbers are examples of those numbers which pass a test described by Fermat's little theorem.
Adding 1 to the product of a finite amount of these was how Euclid proved that there are infinitely many of
these numbers. Any positive integer can be uniquely represented as a product of these numbers in a
namesake factorization, and 2 is the only even example of these. For 10 points, name these numbers
contrasted with the composites, which are only divisible by themselves and 1.
ANSWER: prime number
The Green-Tao theorem states that there exist finitely long arithmetic sequences of these numbers,
and the function pi of n denotes the nth one of these numbers. The Lucas-Lehmer test identifies
whether or not (*) Mersenne numbers have this property, and they can be identified by the Sieve of
Erastosthenes. Euclid proved that there were infinitely many of, for ten points, what numbers, which are
only divisible by one and themselves, the only even one of which is two?
ANSWER: Prime Numbers
The theorem named for them states that the number of these less than a given number n is approximately
equal to n divided by the natural logarithm of n. Specific types of them are named after Sophie Germain and
Marin Mersenne, and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that any positive integer greater than one
can be uniquely expressed as a product of these. They can be found using the sieve of Eratosthenes, and the
first four examples of them are two, three, five, and seven. For 10 points, name this type of number, whose
only divisors are one and itself.
ANSWER: prime numbers
A congruence class Zn (zee en) is a field if and only if n is a member of the set formed by these numbers
The existence of arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of them was proven by Green and Tao. One
theorem about these numbers states that a number a is congruent to a to the n mod n if n has this distinction.
If n divides a times b and n is one of these, then n divides a or b according to Euclid's Lemma. They can be
found using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and another result by Euclid states that there are an infinite number
of them. For 10 points, name these positive integers which have no positive integer divisors other than
themselves and 1.
ANSWER: prime numbers
Robert Carmichael names the set of false-positives in testing for this. Distributed asymptotically, a random
number near a large number N has about a one over natural log of N chance of having it. Landau's
problems, two of which are the Legendre and Goldbach conjectures, concern this property. Most
algorithmic tests for this property are probabilistic, such as the Miller-Rabin test. The Sieve of Atkin is an
optimized method of computing numbers with this property, based on the ancient Sieve of Eratosthenes.
The infinitude of such numbers was proven by Euclid in his Elements. For 10 points, name this property of
natural numbers with exactly two divisors, itself and one.
ANSWER: prime number or primality (accept word forms)
Hadamard and de la Vallee Poussin independently proved this theorem in 1896, and a proof of this
involving only real numbers led to a dispute between Selberg and Erdos (AIR-dawsh). The Hadamard and
de la Vallee Poussin proofs used the zeta function and were followed by a J.E. Littlewood proof that this
theorem is not an inequality that used the Riemann hypothesis. A concise way to state this theorem is that pi
of n equals the logarithmic integral of n, where the logarithmic integral is dx over the natural log of x from
two to n, which is approximately n over the natural log of n. Name this theorem which approximates how
many numbers less than a given number have only one proper divisor.
ANSWER: prime number theorem
The creators of this work aimed to stratify the types seen in Frege's Begriffsschrift. Kurt Godel
combined the formal systems in this work with the Zermelo-Fraenkel axiom system. Based on Peano
Arithmetic, it states that it is impossible to speak of the "set of all sets," an idea expanded into one of
its creator's namesake (*) paradoxes. Godel's two incompleteness theorems were necessitated by its
shortcomings, and it contains a proof of the statement "1+1 = 2". For 10 points, name this foundational
work in mathematics by Russell and Whitehead.
ANSWER: Principia Mathematica
Anatole Rapaport used a four-line algorithm to analyze this setup after Robert Axelrod organized a
tournament where people designed algorithms for this setup, determining that its iterated type is usually best
solved by tit-for-tat. Human players in this setup usually use the formally irrational strategy likely because
reputation factors into the iterated version. Its Pareto-optimal outcome is "both cooperate". For 10 points,
the Nash equilibrium involves both namesake people defecting to the police in what super-basic game
theory game involving two convicts?
ANSWER: iterated prisoner's dilemma
In a book subtitled "the Puzzle of the Bomb," William Poundstone applied this construct to nuclear
warfare. The iterated form of this construct was the subject of a tournament held by Robert Axelrod, which
held that "tit for tat" was the best strategy for approaching it. The only Nash Equilibrium in the iterated
form of this game is to defect every time. In the most common formulation of this game, players receive six
months if both stay loyal but ten years if their partner enters a plea bargain. For 10 points, name this
common situation in game theory.
ANSWER: prisoner's dilemma
Anatol Rapoport came up with the best strategy to solve one version of this
problem developed by Merrill Flood, Melvin Dresher, and Albert Tucker. Robert
Axelrod discussed it in The Evolution of Cooperation and confirmed Rapoport's "tit
for tat" strategy as optimal for its iterated case. It has been applied to such
economic concepts as two-firm price wars and the free rider problem. For 10 points,
name this classic problem in game theory in which two of the namesake people
must choose whether to keep quiet or rat each other out.
ANSWER: prisoner's dilemma
Robert Axelrod wrote about this thought experiment in his The Evolution of Cooperation, and noted
that the best strategies in this situation were those that were "nice", "forgiving", "retaliating", "nonenvious." It was originally posed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher, and the best response to the
(*) iterated version of this problem is the "tit-for-tat" solution. Contrasting the value of altruistic versus
selfish actions, this is, for ten points, what thought experiment, in which two suspects are each offered a
chance to confess to lighten their jail sentence?
ANSWER: Prisoner's Dilemma (accept equivalents)
Developed in 1950 by two employees of the RAND Corporation, its end result is the reason why, in several
countries with civil legal codes, plea bargaining is not allowed. In "Metamagical Themas," Douglas
Hofstadter describes "superrational" players in this game who either know that they are playing with other
superrational players or with those who are only rational or of unknown description. The equilibrium in this
game is Pareto-suboptimal as rational players tend to defect rather than cooperate. FTP what is this game in
which two players, usually described as criminals, either cooperate or betray one another to get a better
payoff from captors?
ANSWER: prisoner's dilemma
Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher formulated this concept while at the RAND Corporation in 1950.
Richard Dawkins suggested that alternate strategies could be more successful than tit for tat in
situations that can be modeled with this concept. William Poundstone related this problem to nuclear
detente in the cold war, while another example described by it included two competing cigarette
advertisers who reached a (*) Nash equilibrium. In the most common formulation of this game, players
receive six months if both cooperate but ten years if their partner defects. For 10 points, name this common
situation in game theory involving two would-be convicts.
ANSWER: The Prisoner's Dilemma
Anatol Rapoport created a simulation of this concept using four lines of BASIC code, while another
simulation is called Pavlov. A related problem posited by Rousseau is the stag hunt, and this concept was
first described by RAND Corporation employees Melvin Dresher and Merrill Flood. Two strategies for a
repeated application of this problem are "tit-for-tat" and "win-stay, lose-switch." One example with multiple
players is the tragedy of the commons, and the only Nash equilibrium for this is when both players defect.
For 10 points, name this situation from game theory in which two players have the option to remain silent or
"rat out" the other.
ANSWER: prisoner's dilemma
Members of the think tank RAND Corporation, Melvin Dresher and Merrill Flood, first outlined this
scenario. Thirty years later, the formulator of the related "tit for tat" strategy, political scientist Robert
Axelrod, created a large tournament concerned with this game, formalized by Albert Tucker. This situation
notably appears in sellers- price collusion and among foreign nations, where impatience with delayed
rewards often breeds cheating and retaliation. FTP, name this game theory "dilemma" dealing with two
criminals- strategies for cooperation or not.
ANSWER: Prisoner's Dilemma Prompt on PD
Changing this situation to make the reward worth more than the temptation creates a stag hunt, which has
two Nash equilibria as compared to one for this situation. Merrill Flood, Melvin Dresher, and Robert
Axelrod were among the scholars who studied this scenario as applicable to nuclear arms. The "tit for tat"
strategy is one approach to this situation. For 10 points, identify this fundamental game theory problem, in
which two suspects must each choose to defect or cooperate.
ANSWER: the prisoner's dilemma
Hardin's tragedy of the commons is sometimes said to be an example of a multi-player generalization
of it. It demonstrates that in a non-zero-sum game, the Nash equilibrium isn-t necessarily Pareto
optimal. In its iterated form, successful strategies tend to be nice, (*) retaliating, forgiving, and nonenvious, making tit-for-tat one of the best deterministic algorithms. In its payoff matrix as described by
Douglas Hofstadter, the sucker's payoff must have the lowest value and the temptation to defect payoff
must have the highest value. FTP, name this game in which each of two players can choose to either
cooperate or defect.
ANSWER: prisoner's dilemma
This scenario was used to model the evolution of reciprocal altruism in a 1971 paper by Robert
Trivers. Proposed by Merril Flood and Melvin Dresher, this scenario tends to be defined by the
conditions T greater than R greater than P greater than S, though related variants relax some of
those conditions. A tournament of its iterated variant was proposed by Robert (*) Axelrod and won by
Anatol Rapoport's "tit for tat" strategy. For 10 points, name this zero-sum problem of game theory, whose
title characters must agree either to stick to their story or to rat each other out.
ANSWER: prisoner's dilemma
Edwin Jaynes and John Maynard Keynes have argued this field should be thought of as an extension of
logic, and Keynes used Bertrand's paradox as an example of how assuming the "principle of indifference"
in this field could lead to confusion. Andrey Kolmogorov used concepts from measure theory in
formulating axioms of this field. John Venn was an early proponent of the frequentist interpretation of it.
Christiaan Huygens wrote the first modern book on it, though it had been discussed earlier in letters
between Pascal and Fermat. An alternative to the frequentist approach in this field is the Bayesian. For 10
points, name this mathematical study of chance.
ANSWER: probability
This function is estimated using window functions in Parzen's method. It is equal to one over two pi times
the Fourier transform of the characteristic function. Performing a double-sided Laplace transform-like
operation on this function, but without the negative sign in the exponential, yields the moment-generating
function. For a random variable x, integrating x times this function of x over the sample space gives the
expectation of x. The integral of this non-negative function over all possible inputs must equal one. This
function can be found by differentiating the cumulative distribution function. For 10 points, name this
function for a continuous distribution whose integral from a to b gives the probability that x lies between a
and b, and thus can be thought of as giving the relative probability that a random variable has value x.
ANSWER: probability density function [or pdf; prompt on probability function]
In category theory, pullbacks are the fiber type of this operation. Performing it on an empty family
will give a terminal object. Modding out the tensor algebra by the ideal generated by every vector
tensor itself gives a space whose elements are formed by the exterior type of this operation. This word
names a topology that preserves compactness by (*) Tychonoff's theorem. For two groups, the direct
sum is isomorphic to the direct type of this operation, where the elements are ordered pairs of elements in
each group and so the underlying set is given by its Cartesian form. One variety of it can be used to find the
volume of parallelpipeds or construct normal vectors and another gives the projection of a vector. For 10
points, name this operation with cross and dot forms.
ANSWER: product
The influential paper Fundamental Concepts in [these things] was written by Christopher Strachey. A
division used in the definition of these things comes in three primary types: operational, axiomatic, and
denotational. These things can have explicit or implicit and static or dynamic type systems. They can
implement namespaces to encapsulate items. One category of these things can be viewed as syntactical
variations of the lambda calculus. Another category of them typically implements subtype polymorphism
and inheritance. Those categories are functional and object-oriented. Compilers work on source code
written in one of these things. For 10 points, identify these things that include Java and are used to write
programs.
ANSWER: programming languages [do not accept or prompt on specific programming paradigms]
A popular one of these constructs was designed by Thomas Kurtz and John Kemeny at
Dartmouth. One sub-class of these entities lack side effects and are exemplified by Miranda and
Clean; those are the "purely functional" types. They-re not context-free grammars, but the
Backus-Naur Form is often used to define syntax in these entities. One of these constructs is named
for (*) Haskell Curry. Type conversion is easy in examples of these constructs that have weak typing.
These constructs are usually supplemented by a standard library. Low level examples of these constructs
include Assembly, while higher-level examples include PHP and Python. For 10 points, name these
constructs that include C, BASIC and Java, used to write programs.
ANSWER: Programming Languages [accept Functional Programming Languages or Purely Functiona Programming Languages before mentioned; accept computer language; prompt on "languages"]
These entities may be typed or untyped, depending on which operations they allow on certain
types of data. Many of these entities are based on Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. These entities
can be classified as logical, (*) functional, or imperative. They typically have an associated standard

can be used to express computations on a computer, examples of which include Perl, Fortran, and
JavaScript.

Guy Steele is a noted creator of these and their grammar is often described in Backus-Naur form. Alan
Kay created one called Smalltalk and they can be classified by their typing and by such paradigms as
imperative, functional, and procedural. They can be object oriented and require an interpreter or compiler.
For 10 points, name these constructs allowing one to tell a computer what to do, examples of which include
C++ and Java.

Interactive and Zero Knowledge ones are recent additions to computational theory, while Appel and
Haken's work on the four color theorem used a computer assisted one. Types include direct, by exhaustion,
and by contradiction which is also refered to as reductio ad absurdum. Starting with known facts and
axioms, they use inductive and deductive reasoning to reach a conclusion followed by the phrase QED. For
10 points, identify these arguments from math and logic that attempt to show that something is true.
ANSWER: proof [accept word forms]
One way to create these things is to use Fermat's [fehr-mah-s] method of infinite descent, which was
applied by Euler [OY-ler] to Fermat's theorem on the sum of two squares. One type of these things has a
strong, or complete, variant in which an assumption applies to a set of numbers instead of just one. That
type, which includes a basis step, is induction. The indirect type of this uses reductio ad absurdum, building
a contradiction. Name this argument establishing a truth that can come in the form of a paragraph or two
columns.
ANSWER: proofs (accept inductive proof or proof by induction, prompt on "induction")
Gerhard Gentzen showed that for each of these entities that uses the cut rule there is another one that does
not use the cut rule. One form of these entities is classified as "by construction", which generally is a subset
of the existence type of these, which can be contrasted with the uniqueness type. Another existence type of
this entity, which is used for limits, is the delta-epsilon type. A common type of this entity starts by
establishing that a statement is true for a particular value and then establishing that whenever the statement
is true for one value, then it is true for the next value, which is known as induction. These statements often
end with the phrase "quod erat demonstrandum", and to organize these entities, some students use two
columns labeled Statements and Reasons, respectively. Name these entities which use deductive logic to
show that their conclusions are true.
ANSWER: proofs
Vardi and Immerman showed that this class can be defined as the problems which can be expressed
in first-order logic plus a least fixed point operator, in the presence of linear order. This class is
equivalent to AL, the class of problems which can be solved in a logarithmic amount of memory
space on an alternating Turing machine. Agrawal, Kayal and Saxena showed that determining the
(*) primality of a number is in this class, and another problem in this class is the decision version of finding
the greatest common divisor. Cobham's thesis states that this class contains all the problems which are
feasibly computable, or "easy" and fast. For 10 points, name this complexity class consisting of all those
problems which can be solved in polynomial time on a deterministic Turing machine, which may or may not
be equivalent to NP.
ANSWER: PTIME
A proof of this theorem by President James A. Garfield involves the calculation of the area of a right
trapezoid by different methods. Another common method of proving this theorem is by inscribing a square
at an angle inside of a larger square, and calculating area of the square both as a whole and as a sum of the
component triangles and smaller square. A special case of the law of cosines, FTP name this theorem
describing the relationship between the length of the legs and the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
ANSWER: Pythagorean theorem
James Garfield used trapezoids to prove this result, which is also proven in Euclid's Elements. With
integral values for its three variables, it gives rise to namesake "triples," which cannot be found for
exponents greater than two, according to Fermat's Last Theorem. It is a special case of the cosine law,
where the angle is ninety degrees. For 10 points, name this theorem which is stated as "A squared plus B
squared equals C squared."
ANSWER: Pythagorean theorem
Applicable when the spread equals one, this statement can be formulated in terms of addition using rational
trigonometry. A generalization of it to inner product spaces is known as Parseval's identity, while a threedimensional generalization is de Gua's theorem. The parallelogram law simplifies to this statement in a
special case, and one proof of this theorem constructs congruent triangles whose areas are half those of a
square and a rectangle. It is generalized by the law of cosines to triangles with any three angles. For 10
points, name this theorem used to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, stated as A squared
plus B squared equals C squared.
ANSWER: Pythagorean theorem
This statement can be extended to three-dimensional figures, according to de Gua's theorem. Its solutions
always include two odd numbers. This statement cannot be proven trigonometrically, because
trigonometric identities are proven using it. It is a specific case of the law of cosines, in which one of the
involved angles is ninety degrees. For 10 points, identify this theorem used to find the hypotenuse of a right
triangle, commonly expressed as "A-squared plus B-squared equals C-squared."
ANSWER: Pythagorean theorem
One generalization of this theorem to three dimensions is known as de Gua's Theorem, and when
Hippasus of Metapontum applied this he was drowned at sea, for he had discovered irrational
numbers. It is a special case of the law of cosines, and (*) triples of this kind include (48, 55, 73), (20, 21
,29), and (5, 12, 13). Generalizing into the distance formula, for ten points, what is this famed geometrical
theorem, stating that a squared plus b squared equals c squared?
ANSWER: Pythagorean Theorem or Pythagorean Triples
One extension of this theorem relates the areas of the faces of a shape in three dimensional space
and is called de Gua's Theorem. One proof of this theorem makes use of three squares in a figure
sometimes called the bride's chair or windmill. This theorem can be obtained from a reduction of (*)
Heron's Formula. Its namesake "triples" can be calculated from this theorem's relation of leg lengths to the
hypotenuse length. For 10 points, name this theorem whose formula is a squared plus b squared equals c
squared, and which is used with right triangles.
ANSWER: Pythagorean Theorem
There are over 367 known proofs for this, including a proof by differential equations, a proof using
similar triangles, a proof by rearrangement, and Euclid's proof which appeared as Proposition 47 in
Book 1 of the Elements. However, there cannot be any (*) trigonometric proof for it because the
trigonometric identities are themselves proven using it. By its converse, which is also true, tying 12 equallyspaced knots in a loop of rope may have allowed ancient Egyptians to construct right angles. A more
general form of it is the law of cosines, which holds true for all triangles. FTP, name this theorem of
Euclidean geometry which states that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of
the squares of its legs.
ANSWER: Pythagorean theorem
A proof of this is nicknamed Dulcarnon [dul-KAHR-non], meaning the owner of two horns, and its diagram
is nicknamed the bride's chair or peacock tail. Another proof involves the dot product of the quantity x plus
y with itself. This is used to prove the British flag theorem, which addresses the distances from a randomly
chosen point in a rectangle to the vertices [VER-tih-sees]. Dependent on the parallel postulate, this is
equivalent to the most basic relationship between sine and cosine, and this is a special case of the law of
cosines. Name this theorem that allows a person to find the length of the third side of a right triangle if they
know the other two, often expressed as a2+b2=c2.
ANSWER: Pythagorean Theorem (accept Pythagoras- Theorem, prompt on "Law of Cosines" or "a^2+b^2=c^2")
A three dimensional analog of this law is De Gua's Theorem. The solutions to the equation associated with
this law always features two odd numbers, and those numbers are called primitive if their greatest common
factor is 1. Euclid proved this relation by using a line that divides a square into two rectangles. It is a
specific
case of the law of cosines in which one of the angles is ninety degrees. For 10 points, name this theorem,
which states that the square of a hypotenuse is equivalent to the sums of the squares of the legs of a right
triangle.
ANSWER: Pythagorean Theorem
E.S. Loomis published a compendium about this statement, which Edsger Dijkstra generalized using the
signum function. Generalized to inner product spaces, this statement is Parseval's identity, while its analog
in three dimensions is de Gua's theorem. Euclid's proof of it, like many others, uses a figure known as the
bride's chair. This statement is logically equivalent to Euclid's parallel postulate, and its generalization to
powers higher than two, proved unsolvable by Andrew Wiles, is Fermat's last theorem. For 10 points, name
this special case of the law of cosines, a statement which states that the sum of the squares of the two legs of
a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse.
ANSWER: the Pythagorean theorem
This theorem is generalized by de Gua's Theorem. The traditional proof of this statement made
use of the "windmill." When using only integers, it is the highest possible case allowed by Fermat's
Last Theorem. Many proofs of it are based on the dissection of shapes. This formula is also used to
determine the norm of a vector in Cartesian space. It is the general case of the law of (*) cosines. For
10 points, name this theorem used to determine the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, written a
squared plus b squared equals c squared.
ANSWER: Pythagorean theorem
Each of these entities has a product divisible by 60, and primitive examples contain exactly one multiple of
five. One method to generate them involves finding numbers whose product is half of a perfect square, and
a method named for Euclid uses the difference of two squares and the sum of the same two squares. These
sets always have an even sum, and their existence makes it necessary to include the requirement that n be
greater than two in Fermat's [fair-mah-z] last theorem. In any one of these sets all three numbers must be
integers, even though the equation they satisfy often gives an irrational third value when the first two are
integers. Name these sets of integers that can be the side lengths of a right triangle.
ANSWER: Pythagorean triple(t)s
They can be generated using a basic Platonic sequence and the Greeks had a formula for generating them
which required two relatively prime numbers of opposite parity. They can be generated using Euclid's
formula and the largest numbers in each set are odd and have prime factors of the form 4n+1. These groups
of numbers are referred to as primitive if they are coprime, although they can all be multiplied by a common
factor. Fermat's Last Theorem can be seen as an attempt to find these kinds of numbers to a higher power
and adding a fourth number generates a namesake quadruple, of which one example is 2,3,6,7. FTP, name
these groups of numbers that include 8,15,17 and 3,4,5.

In December 2005, Google hired the creator of this programming language, Guido van Rossum, who serves
as this language's Benevolent Dictator For Life. This language uses duck typing, so the expression "Ni!"
times 2 evaluates to "Ni!Ni!". It stresses readability, exemplified by its use of whitespace to delimit blocks
of code. A popular development environment for this language is named IDLE, which can run in either a
compiling or on-the-y mode. Including the data types of lists, dictionaries, and tuples, FTP, name this
object-oriented and scripting language named for a British comedy troupe.
ANSWER: Python
Version 3.0 of this language, released in December 2008, is notably incompatible with previous versions.
Code examples in this language often use the variable names "spam" and "eggs." In this language, one can
use a negative index to count backwards from the end of a list. This language uses the Tkinter (T-K-"enter")
package to provide graphics and implements a dynamic but strong typing system called duck typing. This
interpreted language, which spells out the keywords "and" and "not" instead of using symbols, is designed
to have easily readable syntax. For 10 points, name this programming language named for a sketch comedy
show whose name begins with "Monty."
ANSWER: Python
Wingware produces an IDE for this language, which relies heavily on "Duck typing." There are two
different operators used for inequality in this programming language, which also has a feature used for
serialization called "pickle." It can be converted into Java bytecode, and makes use of a lambda construct to
provide support for first-class anonymous functions. The original bittorrent client was written in it, and
matplotlib is its plotting library. IDLE has been bundled with it since its 2.3 release, and ABC and Modula3 were particularly influential in the development of this language, which employs "whitespaces" to delimit
blocks. It is heavily used as a scripting language in web applications, and was developed at CWI by Guido
van Rossum in the 1980s. FTP, name this high-level scripting language that takes its name from a British
comedic troupe rather than a serpent.
ANSWER: Python
While studying imaginary fields described by this adjective, Dirichlet used the class number formula
to prove that certain arithmetic sequences contain infinitely many primes. The signature of a form
described by this adjective is invariant under a change of coordinates, according to Sylvester's
inertia theorem, and the (*) Hessian form can be used to generate one of these forms. A theorem whose
name contains this adjective states that a certain monomial's congruency to "p mod q" is only solvable if
"q-star mod p" is solvable, for distinct odd primes p and q. That theorem is named for this kind of
reciprocity. Polynomials described by this adjective can be graphed based on a focus, directrix, and
eccentricity, and, for 10 points, can be described by what adjective that means "of degree two"?
ANSWER: quadratic
This term refers to a sieve with running time of Ln(1/2,1) ["ell sub n of one half comma 1"]. Gauss
proved a theorem about this type of reciprocity (reh-sih-PRAH-sih-tee) for modular arithmetic.
Functions of this type produce a shape in which all points are equidistant from the directrix and
focus. The derivative of this type of function is linear. The roots of this type of equation are given by
a formula including a (*) discriminant of b2-4ac ["b squared minus four a c"]. For 10 points, name this
term referring to polynomials of degree two.
ANSWER: quadratic
The Legendre symbol has value one whenever an argument is this kind of residue, and the law of
this type of reciprocity was proved by Gauss. This kind of polynomial is the simplest to have a vertex,
and equations of this type can be solved by completing the (*) square. Equations described by this
adjective can be solved by applying the formula negative b plus or minus square root b squared minus 4 a c
all over 2 a and include parabolas. For 10 points, name this term describing equations in the form a x
squared plus b x plus c.
ANSWER: quadratic [accept degree two after "polynomial"]
The rate of convergence of Newton's method is described with this adjective. The existence of
solutions for two particular congruence relations of odd primes p and q is determined by whether
both p and q are congruent to 3 mod 4, according to a reciprocity theorem of this name solved by
Gauss. The discriminant of this type of polynomial is b squared (*) minus four ac, which is found under
a square root to find the roots of this type of equation. For 10 points, name these polynomials of order two,
meaning that they are equal to a times x squared plus b times x plus c.
ANSWER: quadratic [or order two before mentioned]
Euler created a function of this type that generates primes for its first 40 inputs, and, when the inner
product is the standard one, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in Rn states that the product of two
functions of this degree is greater than or equal to a third one squared. All conic sections can be
expressed as two-variable functions of this type, while a single-variable function of this type has a
third derivative of (*) zero. These functions- largest root is negative b plus the square root of b-squared
minus 4ac all over 2a, which can be found by completing the square. For ten points, identify these parabolic
degree-two polynomials like x-squared minus x plus two.
ANSWER: quadratic functions/polynomials/equations (accept degree two or second degree functions before mention, prompt on parabolas or polynomials)
The graphs of these types of functions are used to approximate integrals in Simpson's rule. The
discriminant of this type of polynomial determines the number of real and imaginary roots in the
polynomial, and has the form (*) b squared minus 4ac. For 10 points, name these second-degree
polynomial functions with parabolic graphs, which can be written in the form a x squared plus b x plus c.
ANSWER: quadratic polynomials or quadratic equations (accept degree 2 polynomials or degree 2 equations until "second-degree")
The area of one of these figures can be found with Bretschneider's formula, which reduces to
Brahmaguptra's formula for special cases. In general, their area is "one half the length of the cross
product of the diagonals," and Van Aubel's Theorem shows that the lines connecting the centers of
squares constructed on one's sides are perpendicular and equal. A relation for the side lengths of a
cyclic one of these is given by Ptolemy's theorem. Specific examples of them include kites, trapezoids,
and parallelograms. For 10 points, name this figure which denotes any object with four sides.
ANSWER: quadrilateral [do not accept or prompt on any specific type of quadrilateral]
The radius of a circle circumscribed around one type of these objects is given by Parameshvara's Formula.
The areas of those objects are given by Brahmagupta's Formula, and for cyclic versions, the product of the
lengths of the diagonals can be written in terms of side lengths in Ptolemy's Theorem. Two different types
of these objects can be used to approximate integrals. When pairs of adjacent sides in them have equal
lengths, they have perpendicular diagonals and are called kites. They have two diagonals, and the sum of
their angles is 360 degrees. For 10 points, name these polygons that include trapezoids, parallelograms, and
rectangles, all of which have four sides.
ANSWER: quadrilaterals [Accept cyclic quadrilaterals before "Brahmagupta's.]
These devices- error-correction methods must necessarily take the no-cloning theorem into account, and
the complexity class BQP describes problems that can be solved with these devices. Factoring can be done
in polynomial time on these devices using Shor's algorithm. These devices rely on entanglement between
qubits. For 10 points, identify this type of computer which uses atomic spins or some observable of an atom
to process data, rather than electricity.
ANSWER: quantum computer
The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm was the first one to use these devices to deterministically solve a
problem faster than classical methods, and critical components of them are modeled by Bloch
spheres. Using Grover's algorithm, these devices can search an unsorted database in sub-linear time,
and they are difficult to make and maintain due to the phenomenon of (*) decoherence. Shor's
Algorithm can be run on these devices to factor integers in polynomial time, ruining RSA encryption, and
their namesake objects can be 0, 1, or a superposition of the two. For ten points, identify these not-yet-built
devices, computing engines that make use of qubits.
ANSWER: quantum computers (accept qubits or quantum bits before mentioned)
These objects can undergo amplitude amplification, and they use unitary matrices instead of
stochastic matrices. Simon's algorithm uses one of these to solve a black-box problem. One of them is
used in the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and they can undergo a Fourier transform using Hadamard
gates. They can search an unsorted database in less than linear time and can perform prime
factorization in polynomial time. Those are known (*) as Grover's and Shor's algorithms respectively.
For 10 points, identify these objects which store information in qubits.
ANSWER: Quantum Computers [prompt on computers, I guess]
These devices use the Hadamard gate and other unitary matrix operators to manipulate their inputs. The set
of problems practically solvable by these devices is BQP, which is thought to be a subclass of P. In 2001,
one of these devices was used to show that "15 equals 3 times 5". To do so, a technique developed by Peter
Shor was used, and that technique could one day allow these devices to break RSA. D-Wave has built one
type of these devices, which performs annealing using 128 qubits ("Q-bits"). For 10 points, name these
devices, first proposed by Richard Feynman, that use distinctly non-classical phenomena to execute
algorithms.
ANSWER: quantum computers [prompt on "computers"]
These entities can be used in a form of interpolation called slerping. Every finite p-group that has
every abelian subgroup cyclic is either itself cyclic or is a generalized group of these entities, and the
dicyclic group of order two is isomorphic to the group of them. The factor group of the group of
these entities with their center is isomorphic to the Klein four-group. Those with norm one are called
versors, and these entities follow the complex numbers in the (*) Cayley-Dickson construction.
Symbolized by a blackboard H, they are often used to implement three-dimensional rotations. They consist
of three elements, i, j, and k, whose square is negative one and whose products with each other are
anticommutative. For 10 points, name this four-dimensional number system created by Hamilton.
ANSWER: quaternion
The conjugate of these objects can be found by simply inverting the sign between all four terms. In
computer graphics, Ken Shoemake formulated two ways for handling interpolation between them, one
called Squad and another an adaptation of Bezier curves called a Slerp. One way to create them is to use
the Cayley-Dickson construction. The cross product of these quantities is sometimes referred to as the odd
product, while one mechanism to do non-commutative multiplication with them makes use of the Grassman
product. Unlike their matrix equivalents, they do not run into the problem of Gimbal Lock where a degree
of freedom is lost. Their formulator identified four rules that they must follow, such as the requirement that
the individual square of the i, j, and k components all equal negative one. FTP, identify these extensions to
complex numbers formulated by William Rowan Hamilton that are useful in doing rotations.
ANSWER: Quaternions
An automaton named for one of these structures with an infinite amount of memory is equivalent to a
Turing machine. If this data structure has a limited size, it can be implemented to operate in constant time
using a circular buffer. This structure is used to store the elements to be visited in a breadth-first search.
One type of this data structure is often implemented with a heap, and retrieves elements of highest priority
first. That is its "priority" type. This structure retrieves elements in the opposite order from that of a stack.
For 10 points, name this first-in, first-out data structure, which can be used to model a checkout line.
ANSWER: queue [or priority queue before "priority"]
The Pollaczek-Khinchin formula is used to analyze the M/G/1 type of them, and Kendall's notation is
used to classify them. "Pagoda" and "leftist tree" are names is given to types of one variety of these,
implemented with binary trees, and the van Emde-Boas tree is one of these for which the cost of all
operations is based on the number of keys. A double-ended one of them, also known as a head-tail
linked list, is called a deque [DECK]. Discrete event simulations often make use of the "priority" variety of
this data structure, which is essentially the opposite of a stack. For 10 points, name this first-in-first-out data
structure, used to model lines of waiting people.
ANSWER: queues
Kendall notation allows one to characterize models based on actual instances of this structure. Multilevel
feedback scheduling uses these data structures. Double ended ones are possible while heaps and their
variants are typically used to implement priority ones. This data structure supports a front operation and
this data type is usually contrasted with a stack. For 10 points, name this data structure that is first in first
out and are exemplified by lines at grocery stores.
ANSWER: queue [prompt on FIFO]
A graph-searching method that implements one of these data structures minimizes the number of nodes
visited, and is called breadth-first search. Circular buffers and linked lists are typically implemented using
this type of data structure. Dijkstra's (DYKE-strah's) algorithm uses their priority type. A deque (DECK) is
a double-ended one of these structures. They store data such that the first element inserted is the first
element removed. For 10 points, name this data structure which resembles a ticketing line.
ANSWER: queue
Doug McIlroy described a way to find the worst inputs for this algorithm in "A Killer Adversary
for" it. Switching from it to an in-place algorithm at a sufficiently deep level of recursion results in a
logarithmic worst case runtime in an algorithm developed by David Musser. The complexity of this
algorithm increases as its workload decreases, which is why running it on an ordered list has
complexity O(n^2) ["big oh of en squared"] even though its average runtime is O(n log n) ["big oh of
en log en"]. First developed by (*) C. A. R. Hoare, its second step partitions elements of a list which are
greater and smaller than a pivot. For ten points, name this algorithm, the fastest sorting algorithm known.
ANSWER: quicksort (prompt on sorting algorithm)
This algorithm is sometimes implemented with a switch to a heap-based approach at a sufficiently deep
level of recursion. This solves the problem that when operating on an array that is already in order, this
algorithm degenerates to n squared running time. It works by sorting elements based on whether they are
greater or less than a selected pivot and then recurring for each of those halves. For 10 points, give this O(n
log n) [big-oh of n log n] sorting algorithm named for its rapidity.
ANSWER: quicksort
There are balanced and external variants of this algorithm which is used in the initial steps, but not
for worst case scenarios, in a process developed by David Musser. C.A.R. Hoare developed this
algorithm which chooses an initial pivot value and then separates the list based on their relation to the
pivot value, the algorithm works by continually choosing pivot values from each sub list. With big O
notation, its average performance is n log n, making it advantageous to bubble sort and comparable to
merge sort. For 10 points, name this classic divide and conquer sorting algorithm that is named for its
speed.
ANSWER: Quicksort
A multikey version of this algorithm employs a three-way radix, and the introsort variant switches to
heapsort when a bad case is encountered. In-place implementations of this algorithm requires only O (log n)
[big oh of log n] space. Its quadratic worst case, which occurs when a single element is partitioned in each
step, is much worse than a similar algorithm whose namesake operation joins two sorted sublists, mergesort,
though both perform an average case of O (n log n) [big oh of n log n] comparisons. This algorithm's
essential step picks a pivot element and places only smaller elements to the left of it. For 10 points, name
this divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm developed by C. A. R. Hoare.
ANSWER: quicksort
In 1994, Blair Spearman and Kenneth Williams showed that they could be successfully dealt with only if
two of their coefficients satisfied certain constraints. Three of their other terms can be eliminated before
solving them by using Tschirnhaus transformations. Charles Hermite showed that they could be solved
using elliptic functions, familiar from their use in solving lower-degree analogues of these equations. The
proof of an important theorem concerning these equations depends on finding a subfield of a certain degree
whose splitting field over the rationals has a Galois group isomorphic to a certain symmetric group. For 10
points, name these equations which can be solved if their corresponding Galois groups are solvable, and for
which no general radical solution exists, as shown by the Abel-Ruffini theorem.
ANSWER: quintic equations [accept fifth-degree polynomial or fifth-degree equation before mentioned; also accept quintic formula or quintic expression]
An equation equivalent to one of these equations but with only three terms can be expressed using the
Bring-Jerrard normal form, which uses the Tschirnhaus ["CHURN-house"] transformation. These are the
simplest equations addressed by the Abel-Ruffini [AH-bul roo-FEE-nee] theorem, also known as Abel's
impossibility theorem, and they are also the simplest equations for which Galois [gal-wah] theory can be
used on a case-by-case basis to determine whether or not they are solvable. The graph of one of these
polynomials can have at most four critical points, two local maximums, and two local minimums, and when
simplified these equations can have at most six terms. Name these polynomials with degree five.
ANSWER: quintic polynomials [or quintic equations; accept fifth-degree polynomials or degree-five polynomials before "five"]
A common proof of this rule involves subtracting f of x times g of x and adding the same quantity in
between two terms. That step allows g of x to be factored from the first two terms and the opposite of f of x
to be factored from the last two terms, and the differences those terms are multiplied by can then be divided
by h to follow the general form for simple derivatives. The entire quantity gets divided by g of x times g of
the quantity x+h, which approaches g squared of x. Another method to prove this rule uses the chain rule
and the product rule. Name this rule for finding a derivative when one function is divided by another
function.
ANSWER: quotient rule
This unit must be used for one of the quantities so that the small oscillation restoring force of a pendulum
can be approximated as mass times little g times theta. This unit also must be used for the common Taylor
series approximation x minus x cubed over six plus x to the fifth over one hundred twenty, etcetera. One
way to define this unit is arc length divided by radius, which is why numbers measured in these units can be
multiplied by numbers in other units without changing those other units. This unit can be thought of as the
number of radii that would fit along the arc inscribed in an angle, and it equals approximately 57.3 degrees.
Give this unit that can be converted to by multiplying pi over one hundred eighty times the number of
degrees.
ANSWER: radians
In November 2007, in an interview, Google CEO Eric Schmidt asked then-Senator Barack Obama a
computer science question to which this is the correct answer. It dates back to 1887 to Herman Hollerith's
work on tabulating machines for censuses, and an old IBM 80 series machine used to use it to sort punched
cards at a rate of up to 2000 per minute. The most intuitive way to implement it starts from the most
significant digit, but only the version starting from the least significant digit is a stable sort. For ten points,
name this sorting algorithm, related to bucket sort, which by knowing bounds on the range of its data is able
to sort in linear time, and whose name is also a synonym for a number base.
ANSWER: radix sort
The Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine utilized an early form of this entity known as the
Williams Tube. If CPU performance improves faster than this entity can function, a disparity in speed
known as a memory wall may arise. One type of this entity must be refreshed periodically and makes use of
capacitors; in addition to that dynamic type, this has phase change and static varieties. Modern computers
often possess a few gigabytes of storage of this entity, which mainly comes in volatile types that lose the
information they contain when a system loses power. For 10 points, name this type of storage that permits a
user to retrieve data in any order.
ANSWER: RAM [or random access memory]
One type of this construct transfers data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal and is
known as the "double data rate" variety of this. One of the two most basic varieties of this item stores bits as
the states of flip-flops while the other variety stores each bit in a unique capacitor. Coming in static and
dynamic varieties, for 10 points, identify this volatile type of memory used for temporary data storage, often
contrasted with read-only memory.
ANSWER: RAM [or random-access memory; prompt on memory; accept DRAM or dynamic random- access memory until "flip-flops" is read]
The DDR3 type of this device supports triple-channel architecture. Its most common type stores data by
charging and discharging capacitors in an integrated circuit. Both that dynamic type and its static variety
require a constant power supply to function. Unlike x86 architecture, 64-bit processor architectures support
more than four gigabytes of this storage. For 10 points, name this volatile computer memory in which
programs and data are stored while they are being run.
ANSWER: RAM [or random-access memory]
Placing a register between this structure and the controller creates the "registered" or "buffered" form of
it. Attempting to read data not currently stored in this triggers a page fault. Flip-flops are used to implement
the static type of it, while capacitors are used in the dynamic type. Its main benefit is that reading or writing
to any spot is done in constant time. For 10 points, identify this type of volatile memory, used in modern
computers as the main storage for running programs.

An important measure of this thing's performance is CAS latency. The individual cells of this thing
consists of a transistor-capacitor pair. If the capacity of this thing is not enough, one can supplement it with
a page file or swap partition. Portable computers, like laptops, typically use it in its "SO-DIMM" form. It is
primary storage and its most common type is the third version of its double data rate, synchronous dynamic

One factor in the performance of this technology is the timing of the RAS and CAS signals. In
smartphones, this technology is what is usually stacked on top of a SoC to make a PoP. This technology is
composed of constantly refreshing capacitor containing cells. This computer component is based on the
DDR family of standards and comes in physical DIMMs. Unlike SSDs or hard drives, this subsystem
forgets its content when shutdown. For 10 points, name this computer component used to store active
information and programs.
ANSWER: DRAM [or dynamic random access memory; prompt on partial answer]
One type of this device stores data in circuits having two stable states known as flip-flops such that the
device need not be externally refreshed, while another type uses single capacitors. Flash is a nonvolatile
type
of this device, which can come in dynamic or static types. If this device is insufficient for a certain task, a
computer will use some hard drive space in a process known as swapping. For 10 points, name this
temporary type of storage in which data can be retrieved at some constant time regardless of its relation to
other data.
ANSWER: RAM [or random access memory; prompt on memory]
One kind of this device consists of a grid of magnetic tunnel junctions. Besides the magnetoresistive type,
another kind of this device has one word-line and two bit-lines per charge storage cell. CAS latency is the
time needed to access one of this device's modules. Its capacity can be increased by creating a paging file.
Both its dynamic and static versions are volatile, meaning loss of power causes loss of information. For 10

Using a primitive polynomial, this type of output can be obtained from a linear feedback shift
register. An algorithm that produces an output with this property has a period of 2 to the 19,937th
power minus one. Running this kind of quicksort can bound the worst-case runtime against
malicious inputs. This kind of output is produced by the Mersenne Twister, and it is often necessary
to "seed" functions that produce this type of output when using said functions. These kinds of inputs
are necessary to perform (*) Monte Carlo algorithms, and this kind of process can be modeled using a
Markov chain. The N in NP describes this type of polynomial. For 10 points, name this synonym of
nondeterministic that describes numbers with no predictable pattern.
ANSWER: pseudorandomness [or nondeterministic until it is read]
This synonym of stochastic describes the type of numbers that seem to be the output of the Mersenne
twister. Though that algorithm does not produce an output useful in cryptography, the output of Blum Blum
Shub does. Those algorithms output the "pseudo" type of these numbers, meaning that they are actually
deterministic despite appearing otherwise. Walks of this type are used to simulate certain situations,
including Brownian motion. Name these numbers used in Monte Carlo simulations, sequences of which can
be generated by spinners or dice.
ANSWER: (pseudo)random numbers [prompt on non-deterministic]
These entities are produced by Park and Miller's MINSTD method. One way to produce these entities is the
middle-square method of John von Neumann. These entities are often created using a linear congruence
method. Suboptimal ones of these exhibit serial correlation, whereas optimal ones pass the next-bit test.
Nuclear decay or shot noise can form the basis of hardware methods for these objects, and software
methods use generation from an initial seed. Often used for cryptographic or statistical purposes, for ten
points, identify these unpredictable quantities.
ANSWER: random numbers (accept pseudorandom numbers)
As nonces, these entities are used to prevent replay attacks. One way to find these is the Mersenne
twister and these are used in Monte Carlo simulations. Unless an outside source of entropy is present,
the algorithm producing them is seeded with the current time or similar value. A collection of these
numbers should follow a (*) statistical distribution and be free of patterns allowing one to determine the
next one produced based on the previous ones produced. For 10 points, name these numbers that are
usually generated using the rand function.
ANSWER: pseudo-random numbers [or pseudo-random number generators before "numbers should"]
A popular algorithm for performing this action uses a recurrence relation in which x sub n plus 1 is
set equal to x sub n squared. Another popular method of doing this has a period of two to the power
19937 minus 1, and is a variant of the generalized feedback shift register. The Diehard tests are used
to evaluate the efficacy of these programs, which include the Blum Blum Shub method and the
Mersenne Twister. The input from performing this process is obtained either from digits in the internal
clock or some physical input like radioactive decay to obtain seed values. For 10 points, name this process

A function that defines these things can be found by taking the Radon-Nykodym derivative of the
induced measure with respect to a counting or a Lebesgue measure. The properties of these things
can be defined by taking the first and second derivatives of the moment-generating function and
evaluating them at zero. The joint CDF for these things is given by the convolution of each one's CDF.
For one of these denoted capital X, the expected value of X squared minus the expected value of X, all

Gerard Desargues (deh-SAR-g-) used this term to refer to the number of labeled points on a line segment.
By a more common definition, this value is equal to two times the standard deviation for either/or situations
such as coin tosses and greater than twice the standard deviation otherwise, and this is a non-robust
dispersion statistic. By another definition, this term has a similar meaning to codomain, though it refers to
only the set which the output values of a function take on rather than the set of possible values. Give this
term which with respect to sets is the difference between the largest value and the smallest value, and which
with respect to functions is to "output" as domain is to "input".
ANSWER: ranges
The type of function described by this adjective has no singularities other than poles in the complex
plane. Each of these numbers has a unique p-adic expansion, and a p-adic number is an extension of
this set. The Farey sequences list all of these between 0 and 1. Dedekind cuts are made strictly
between two of these. The Dirichlet function applied to one of these equals 1. Cauchy sequences
consisting of these can be used to complete the field of these to the reals. A polynomial with these

Heronian triangles have these numbers for both side lengths and areas. A spiral can be used to show that
these numbers are countably infinite, and they are an unusual combination of countable and dense.
Functions named for this set can have at most one oblique or horizontal asymptote but may have many
vertical asymptotes or removable discontinuities. When coefficients of a polynomial are integers, a list of
possible zeroes in this set can be generated by its namesake root theorem. The set can be represented as

ANSWER: rational numbers (accept Q before mentioned)
The first and last coefficients of an integer polynomial can be used to guess solutions to the polynomial

used to show that this set of numbers is countable. Euclid [YOO-klid] demonstrated that assuming that the
square root of two is in this set leads to a contradiction. Name this set of numbers, each of which can be
represented by repeating or terminating decimals and also can be represented as the quotient of two

ANSWER: rational numbers
Niven's theorem states that if "x over pi" and "sine x" are both of this type, then sine x equals positive or

This set of numbers has the least cardinality greater than that of the integers, according to the
continuum hypothesis, and is the union of the algebraic and transcendental numbers. This complete
totally ordered field can be constructed by Cauchy sequences, and this set is (*) uncountable according

numbers denoted R.
ANSWER: real numbers (accept R before the end)
The long line is path connected and locally homeomorphic to this set in the standard topology, but cannot
be embedded in it. Paul Cohen used forcing to prove the independence of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms
and a hypothesis regarding the cardinalities of this set and one of its subsets. Hilbert defined this system
with 18 axioms that imply it is the largest Archimedean field, and up to isomorphism it is the only ordered
field with the least upper bound property. Dedekind cuts and equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences
provide two methods for constructing this system, which was proved to be uncountable by Cantor's
diagonal argument. For 10 points, name this set that can be decomposed into algebraic and transcendental
numbers, or into rational and irrational numbers.
ANSWER: the real numbers or R
In a system based on these numbers, any non-empty set bounded above has a least upper bound. These can
be constructed by taking Dedekind [DEH-duh-kund] cuts of a smaller set. These numbers form the only
complete totally ordered field, and, as it did with the irrational numbers, Cantor diagonalization [die-AGnull-i-ZAY-shun] demonstrated that this set is uncountable. The set of imaginary numbers can be generated

A group action of this space on the phase space giving the solutions of an ODE is called a flow. Up to
homeomorphism, this space is the unique connected non-compact 1-manifold without boundary, and
its one-point compactification gives the homeomorphic to S1. In this space bounded monotone
sequences converge, implying the (*) Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Every non-empty subset of this space
has a supremum, and, up to isomorphism, it is the unique Archimedean complete ordered field. The
elements of this space can be constructed using Cauchy sequences or as partitions of the rational numbers
called Dedekind cuts. Its elements are the fixed points under complex conjugation. For 10 points, name this
space composed of the rational and irrational numbers.
ANSWER: real numbers [or real line; or R; or R1]
The Lebesgue measure assigns lengths to subsets of these, and these are both separated and formed by
Dedekind cuts. Every monotone sequence of these converges if and only if it is bounded, and every
sequence of these is Cauchy if and only if it is convergent. These contain no infinite or infinitesimal
elements and satisfy the least upper bound property; consequently these form the only complete
Archimedean ordered field. Georg Cantor used a diagonal argument to demonstrate the uncountability of
these numbers that can be represented by infinite decimal expansions. For 10 points, name this set
containing the algebraic and transcendental numbers, contrasted with the imaginary numbers.
ANSWER: real numbers [or reals, or R]
These numbers can be defined as the members of the only complete, ordered Archimedean field. One way
of constructing them is by dividing a certain subset of these numbers that is dense in them into two disjoint
subsets, one of which has no greatest element. The conjecture that there is no set with cardinality between
that of these numbers and that of the integers is inconsistent with ZFC set theory. That conjecture is the
continuum hypothesis. These numbers are not algebraically closed, since polynomials with these numbers as
coefficients can have roots such as "i", the square root of negative one. For 10 points, name these numbers
which have no imaginary part.
ANSWER: real numbers
The Vitali Set is a non-measurable subset of this class. Axiomatized by Alfred Tarski, this class can be
considered as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences which can be used to see that each Cauchy sequence
converges. It has the least upper bound property in that any set bounded above has a supremum, and this
complete metric space can be constructed using Dedekind cuts. As shown in Cantor's diagonalization
argument it has an uncountably infinite number of elements. These numbers that contain the irrational
numbers can be written using infinite decimals. For 10 points, name these numbers that are not imaginary,
represented by a capital R.
ANSWER: real numbers (accept R before mentioned)
An estimate for certain functions on collections of these is given by Ingham's theorem. Richard's paradox
arose out of attempts to define these mathematical entities in natural language. Abraham Robinson's theory
extended these by creating a new system where each item consisted of one of these and a halo. These make
up the only complete ordered field. One method for defining these uses Dedekind cuts. The question of
whether there was another set smaller than it is the subject of the Continuum hypothesis and the size of this
set was shown to be greater than one of its subsets by Cantor's diagonalization argument. For 10 points,

The Archimedean property is a key property of these numbers as they are an ordered field. These can be
constructed using Cauchy sequences or Dedekind cuts. The fact that they are uncountable can be
demonstrated using Cantor's diagonal argument. They can be divided into the rational numbers and the
irrational numbers. They can be written as decimal representations with an infinite sequence of digits after
the decimal point. For 10 points, name these numbers, the set of which is represented by a capital R.
ANSWER: real numbers
Every complete ordered field is isomorphic to this set of numbers. These numbers can be defined as
equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences or they can be constructed as intervals of rational numbers called
Dedekind cuts. Georg Cantor showed that no list could contain all of these numbers, which showed that the
set of these numbers is (*) uncountable. Another way to define these numbers is as those with decimal
expansions. For ten points, identify this set of numbers, consisting of all rational and irrational numbers,
symbolized R.
ANSWER: real numbers (accept R before mention)
The Erd}os-Graham Conjecture concerns when 1 is expressible as a sum of these entities. A commutative
ring in which all nonzero elements have one of these is called a field. All positive rational numbers can be
expressed as a sum of these entities corresponding to positive integers. The harmonic series is the sum of
these entities over the positive integers. Division by a number x can be achieved by multiplying by this
function of x. Also called a multiplicative inverse, for ten points, identify this term for 1 divided by a given

This is the least restrictive quadrilateral for which the sum of the squares of the distances from any point in
the interior to two opposite diagonals equals the same sum for the other opposite diagonals. It is also the
least restrictive quadrilateral for which the intersection of the diagonals is the same distance from each of
the four vertices. Its four angles are all congruent, but its sides are not necessarily congruent. Name this
quadrilateral with four right angles.
ANSWER: rectangle
The British Flag Theorem deals with sums of squares of distances from an interior point in this
figure. Cutting a square off the "golden" variety of this figure yields another "golden" one, and
gluing two opposite edges of this figure after giving it a half-twist yields a (*) Mobius strip. This
figure's diagonal has length equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of its two perpendicular sides,
a consequence of all of its angles being right. For ten points, name this type of quadrilateral which has four
90-degree angles, whose area is equal to its base times its height.
ANSWER: rectangles (prompt on quadrilateral, trapezoid, or parallelogram, do not accept or prompt rhombus or square)
If a call is the "tail" variety of this, a functional language will not add that call to the stack. Memoization
provides a faster alternative to this concept, which is exponentially slow in the case of computing the
Fibonacci numbers. This idea is the basis for divide-and-conquer algorithms, which break a problem down
into smaller sub-problems until either a stack overflow occurs or a base-case problem is reached. This
concept is also used by the relation that defines the Fibonacci sequence and by the factorial function. For 10
points, identify this concept in computing, wherein a function references itself.
ANSWER: recursion [accept word forms; do not accept "INCEPTION"]
The"mu" type of this property contains all examples of the "primitive" subtype; one non-primitive entity
which cannot be expressed without this property is the Ackermann function. In computer science, tail calls
can create one form of it, and divide-and-conquer algorithms such as the quicksort use it on large problems.
Relying on a base case, examples of it in math include solutions to the Tower of Hanoi problem, the
factorial, and the adding of two Fibonacci numbers to get the next one in sequence. For 10 points, name this
form of iteration, by which a function calls back prior values of itself to generate new ones.
ANSWER: recursion [or recursive function; prompt recursion or recursive function]
This property is utilized in the most common alternative to a table-based parser in context-free
grammars, a certain type of "descent parser." This property is central to the Kleene-Rosser paradox in
the original lambda calculus, and the Ackermann function has the mu form of this property, but not the
primitive type. For 10 points, name this property used to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, defined as
the application of a function within its own definition.
ANSWER: recursion [accept word forms]
The use of this technique to solve optimization problems is evaluated by the Bellman equation and is known
as dynamic programming. This programming technique has a tail form that can always be converted to
loops. Functions that are effectively calculable by this process via the lambda calculus are the subject of the
Church-Turing thesis. A method for finding the factorial of n uses this technique by multiplying n by the
factorial of n - 1 until the function hits its base case. For 10 points, name this programming technique
invoked when a function calls itself.
ANSWER: recursion [accept word forms, accept dynamic programming before mention]
Fixed point combinators can be used to implement this concept anonymously. Lazy evaluation means
this concept can be used to create lists whose values are generated only as they are needed, and data types
often defined using this concept include linked lists and trees. The "tail" variety can be optimized and it's
commonly illustrated with the Towers of Hanoi or the factorial function. Often defined using one or more
base cases, for 10 points, name this computer science technique wherein a function calls itself.

Fibonacci sequence. For 10 points, name this programming technique, often contrasted with iteration, in
which a function calls itself.
ANSWER: recursion [or recursivity; or recursive functions; accept word forms]
If a grammar has the left form of this concept, parsing it may result in shift-reduce conflicts, while functions
which exhibit the tail form of this do not build up any deferred operations. A naive algorithm which utilizes
this process to calculate Fibonacci numbers can result in exponential time complexity. Data structures
utilizing this concept include binary trees and linked lists, as the dynamic positioning of nodes may
theoretically go on infinitely and the positioning of child nodes depends on previously allocated parent
nodes. For ten points, identify this concept in computer science, exhibited by functions which call
themselves.
ANSWER: recursion (Accept recursion.)
Determining a relation of this type is the first step in finding generating functions, and one non-primitive
function of this type is the Ackermann function. In computer science, the divide and conquer algorithm
solves a problem by forming two problems of half the size and solving each half-problem via this method.
This method can be used to generate the factorial because the factorial is n times the factorial of n-1, and the
Fibonacci sequence is also defined as this type of sequence because its terms are found from previous terms
in the sequence. For 10 points, identify this method, which defines a function's values based on its previous
values.
ANSWER: recursion [accept word forms]
The Ackermann function must be expressed using this concept, and it is often used to define fractals such as
the Sierpinski triangle. This technique is employed by the fastest algorithms for computing factorials, and

ANSWER: recursion [accept word forms such as recursive]
One function that cannot be expressed without using this technique is the Ackermann function. This
technique is used to divide a list in half repeatedly in a binary search. This method can also be used to solve
the Towers of Hanoi problem and to find elements of the Fibonacci sequence. For 10 points, identify this
programming technique contrasted with iteration, the act of a function calling itself.
ANSWER: recursion [accept word forms]
This concept is invoked to resolve the Kleene-Rosser paradox. Divide and conquer algorithms are
based on the multi-branch type of this strategy, and all functions of this type can be transformed into
iterative functions using a stack. Examples of this method include the solution to the (*) Towers of
Hanoi problem and defining the Fibonacci sequence. For 10 points, name this method of defining function
in which the definition applies the function itself, also a means of solving problems in computer science by
solving many smaller instances of the same problem.
ANSWER: recursion
This type of method can be optimized by reusing the stack frame of the previous function call; that is
known as tail optimization. Functions that commonly use this method include the divide-and-conquer
solution to Towers of Hanoi and mergesort. A function that uses this procedure without a base case will run
forever. Commonly used in binary tree traversals, for 10 points, name this method where a function
references itself in its definition.
ANSWER: recursion [or recursive functions]
A process known as dynamic programming that uses the Bellman equation makes use of this
technique to find solutions to optimization problems. Its "mu" type is expressed in the Ackermann
function, and it is applied in lambda calculus to fix the Kleene-Rosser paradox. Its "tail" type can be
expressed in (*) iteration, and use of this technique is present in the solution to the Towers of Hanoi
problem. The Fibonacci sequence is often identified as this because it applies past terms. For 10 points,
name this programming method in which a function calls itself.
ANSWER: recursion [accept word forms like recursive]
Functions that are of the mu form of this correspond to the functions that are computable by a Turing
Machine, while an example of a function that is not of the primitive form of this is the Ackermann function.
Instances where no deferred operations have to be done is known as the tail form and is often optimized by
compilers. Often used in divide and conquer algorithms like tree traversal, a base case is used to create a
point where the functions start returning thus ending an infinite series of dependencies. For 10 points,
identify this concept in mathematics and computer science seen in the Fibonacci sequence in which a
function is defined in terms of itself.
ANSWER: recursion [accept word forms like recursive]
The Ackermann function cannot be expressed without using this procedure, and every effectively
calculable function is general this by Church's thesis. All functions defined by course-of-values this
are primitive this, and operations expressed using the "tail" form of this may easily be translated into
(*) iteration. Binary search uses this process to repeatedly divide a list into halves. Often used to calculate
elements of the Fibonacci sequence or values of the factorial function, for 10 points, name this process
wherein a function calls itself.
ANSWER: recursion [or word forms such as recursive]
The tail version of this process can be used to save space on the call stack. Used in functional computer
languages, this technique can be found in divide and conquer algorithms like merge- and quicksort. This
process is also used in solving problems like the Towers of Hanoi and in the Fibonnacci sequence. For 10
points, name this method which describes an implementation where a function calls itself within a program.
ANSWER: recursion [accept word forms]
In a strongly normalizing language, functions with this property would have infinitely long types. The "tail-"
form of this property allows looping constructs and operations like GCD to be run in constant stack space.
Definitions of this sort describe a tree as a structure whose leaves are trees and a Peano numeral as zero or
the successor of a Peano numeral. The Ackermann function is a computable function that does not satisfy
the "primitive" form of this property. FTP, identify this computer science concept, closely related to
mathematical induction, that is often demonstrated with the Tower of Hanoi, the factorial function, or the
Fibonacci series.
ANSWER: recursive (accept word forms)
Under the substitution model, processes of this type build a chain of deferred operations. Languages
like Ada, Pascal, and C require an unbounded amount of memory to realize these procedures,
necessitating use of "looping constructs" like "for" and "while". The IEEE Scheme standard
requires the "tail-" form of this property, so procedures like Euclid's algorithm will never exhaust the
stack space. For ten points, identify this class of procedures exemplified by the natural solution to Towers
of Hanoi and by Merge sort, which contrasts with iterative and in which a function is defined in terms of
itself.
ANSWER: Recursive
In addition to being constant, McCarthy 91 is this type of function for all inputs less than or equal to 100.
Kleene's theorem relates these functions to computable functions. As long as x does not equal zero, the
Ackermann function is of this type, but it is not primitively so. In computer science, these functions are
sometimes classified based on whether they use only tail calls or whether they build up values. The simplest
types of these functions are defined inductively, and definition via this technique is useful for some
functions that cannot be expressed explicitly. Name these functions calculated in terms of themselves.
ANSWER: recursive functions [accept word forms of recursion]
In Euclidean geometry, the finite groups formed by this type of mapping are equivalent to the finite Coxeter
groups. In computer science, this term refers to the ability of a program to treat itself as data, allowing the
program to modify itself. Matrices that perform this operation in two-space often take the form with top row
cosine two theta, sine two theta and bottom row sine two theta, negative cosine two theta; those matrices
have a determinant of negative one. This term also refers to certain relations that relate f of the quantity a
minus x end quantity to f of x. When this type of transformation is combined with a translation, the result is
its glide type. For even functions, this transformation can be found over the y-axis without changing the
graph. Name this transformation that finds a mirror image.
ANSWER: reflection [accept word forms]
The Briggs method for making decisions about these units includes a coalescing phase. One class of
algorithms for controlling these considers deleted nodes to be spilled and nodes in general to be live ranges.
Second chance bin-packing is an algorithm designed to handle these units. The linear scan algorithm
manages these in a greedy fashion, and many other algorithms for managing them are based on graph
coloring. The number of general instances of these components were doubled in x86_64 architecture over
x86, and in x86 examples of these include ax and bx. In load store architectures like MIPS, in order to
perform arithmetic or logical operations on the data, the data must be placed in these. For 10 points, name
these fast stores of temporary data on a CPU that are separate from the main memory, unlike caches.
ANSWER: registers
One assumption this method relies on is the preservation of homoscedasticity, which can be confirmed
using a residual plot. An important value for this technique is equal to the r-value times the quotient of the
standard deviations of the dependent and independent variables. The square of the correlation coefficient is
a measure of the accuracy of this technique, and it is often computed with the "least squares" method. For
10 points, name this statistical technique used to fit a trendline to data.
ANSWER: Linear Regression [accept Least Squares Regression; prompt on Line of Best Fit or Trendline before mention]
A non-parametric method of performing this technique is the Theil-Sen estimator. The
Gauss-Markov theorem gives the best linear unbiased estimator when error terms from this
technique fulfill certain criteria. For a type of this process, the sum of squares total minus sum of
squares error all divided by sum of squares total yields the r-squared value, which is also called the
coefficient of determination and gives the percentage of variance explained. That type of this
technique minimizes the sum of squared (*) residuals and is the least-squares method. "Influential"
outliers unduly influence the slope obtained from the linear form of this process. For 10 points, name this
process which gives a mathematical model for the association between a dependent and one or more
independent variables.
ANSWER: regression analysis [or least-squares regression; or simple linear regression]
For Sturm-Liouville problems to be of this type, the two boundary conditions must be linearly
independent. This word also describes points at which all coefficient functions in a standard form
differential equation are analytic. In both of those definitions, this word contrasts with singular, as it also
does to describe matrices that have inverses. All vertices have the same degree in this sort of graph. This
word also describes expressions that, like grammars, can define the languages of finite automata; those
expressions are often used in string matching. For 10 points, identify this word that also applies to polygons
in which the side lengths and angle measures are all equal.
ANSWER: regular
Omega languages with this property consist of infinite words which are equivalent to Buchi automata. This
property describes sets of strings which correspond to DSPACE of big O of one; such languages must have
a finite number of "distinguishing strings" such that each appended string forms an equivalence class. These
languages are the subject of the Myhill-Nerode theorem and correspond to type-3 languages, right-linear
grammars, and left-linear grammars. Concatenation and the Kleene Star are two operations that can be
applied to a tool described by this adjective, which can be used to search for strings. For 10 points,
expressions that are used by Linux's "grep" can be described by what adjective?
ANSWER: regular [accept type-3 before mention]
By evaluating one over n prime times the integral from a to x of quantity x minus t to the n plus f n plus
one of t dt, this amount can be found for the Taylor series. Performing the modulo operation yields this
value. A story about a woman who loses a basket of eggs is often used to introduce a method to work
backwards given several of these values; that is the "Chinese" theorem about them. This number is obtained
alongside a quotient. For 10 points, name this amount left over during a division.
ANSWER: remainder [or residual]
If a plot of these values has an uneven envelope, it is a sign that data is
heteroscedastic [HET-uh-roh-skeh-DAAS-tik], which means that different parts of the data have
different variances. If these numbers follow a "U"-shaped pattern on a graph, it is an indication that
a poor model has been chosen for the data. Regression methods minimize the sum of the squares of
these values. These values apply to bivariate data in a way that is similar to the way deviations are
used with single-variable data. Identify these values, sometimes confused with errors, that are equal
to the difference between an observed value and the predicted value from a best-fit curve.
ANSWER: residuals [prompt on deviations; do not accept "standard deviation(s)"]

determining whether a function is holomorphic. He is also known for a function for which a namesake
hypothesis states that all trivial non-zeros of the function have real part one-half. For 10 points, name this
formulator of a zeta function and a method of integration which involves using his namesake sums.

whose namesake sums are used to approximate definite integrals.
ANSWER: Bernhard Riemann
This mathematician is the namesake of a sphere formed by mapping points from the plane and adding a
point at infinity, and he is also the namesake of objects which locally look like the complex plane but as a
whole can be a curved surface. A function named after him is related to functions named after Dirichlet

ANSWER: Riemann sum (prompt on integration before "right")
The most useful algorithm for computing it is named after Odlyzko and Schonhage, and is far more
computationally efficient than the algorithm named partly after Siegel. Beukers' integral is used to
approximate one value of it; that value was proven to be irrational and is known as Apery's constant.
Trivial zeroes exist at every even negative integer, while if its nontrivial zeroes have real part equal to one

ANSWER: Riemann Zeta Function
The Montgomery-Odlyzko Law relates this function to the distribution of eigenvalue spacings in a
GUE operator, and the limit of this function applied to s minus one over quantity s minus one yields
the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The Dirichlet eta function, sometimes referred to as its (*)
"alternating" form, is equal to this function of s times quantity one minus two to the quantity one minus s,

Though it converges at 0, it diverges at 1 due to the divergence of the Harmonic Series. The study of this
function is often focused on the Z-Function, which is restricted to the critical line. Hardy showed that this

expansion. Borwein and Hrass developed a convergent series approximation for this function, and
the polylogarithm reduced to it when k = 1. Its value at 3 is equal to Apery's constant, while it can be
expanded into a Taylor series using Stieltjes constants. Rapidly converging series for odd values of the

Karatsuba proved one conjecture regarding this entity posited by Atle Selberg, and the reciprocal of
this function gives a Dirchlet series involving the Mobius function. Apery's constant is defined using
this function, and expanding this function out as a Laurent series around s equals 1 gives the Stieltjes

ANSWER: Riemann zeta function
The development of etale cohomology by Pierre Deligne made possible the proof of analogues of this result
describing the number of points on certain projective varieties over finite fields, and in addition to these
Weil conjectures, this result is associated with criteria named for Riesz and Li. Like a disproven conjecture
of Mertens, it may be interpreted as a growth bound on a function related to partial sums of the Mobius
function, and it also implies a strong error bound on the prime number theorem. For 10 points, identify this
conjecture formulated in the 1859 paper On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude, which
asserts that all the zeroes of a certain function lie on the "critical line" of complex numbers with real part

The Lambert quadrilateral is a quadrilateral which possesses three of these things, while a Saccheri
quadrilateral has two of them. Euclid's fourth postulate states that all of these things are congruent. The area
of a triangle in spherical geometry which has three of these things is equal to one-half pi times the radius of
the sphere squared. Thales- theorem states if a triangle inscribed in a circle has a diameter for one side, one

One measure of the dimensionality of these objects is the least upper bound on the heights of its
closed, additive group-forming sub-modules. The unmixedness theorem holds for examples of these
objects in which the aforementioned dimensionality measure is equal to the depth. That
dimensionality measure is the Krull dimension, which is equal to the depth in the examples of these
named for Cohen and Macaulay. The major classifications of these objects are in terms of chain
conditions. The aforementioned closed, additive group-forming sub-modules of these objects are
know as prime (*) ideals; an ideal is a sub-module of one of these that commutes with all its elements.
These algebraic structures are closed under both an associative, commutative addition, identity-bearing
invertable addition, and a left- and right-distributive, associative multiplication. For 10 points, name these
algebraic structures that may be Artanian or Noetherian.
ANSWER: rings [prompt on fields or modules]
Euler's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for the n equals 3 case involved extending integer arithmetic
to one of these structures, which contain numbers of the form a plus b times the square root of
negative 3. Dedekind defined an ideal complex number based upon a property related to these
structures and Hilbert utilized (*) polynomial ones to solve his Basis Theorem. The advent of quaternion
algebra and the extension of the axioms of this structure to square matrices led to the formulation of its non-
commutative theory and the first single theory of the abstract commutative variety of these structures was
proposed by Noether. FTP, what are these mathematical objects defined as a set containing two operators
that satisfy a collection of axioms.
ANSWER: ring
Two of these objects are said to be Morita-equivalent if there is an equivalence between their module
categories. Every local example of one of these objects has a finite Krull dimension and modules are
defined over these objects. Examples of these objects satisfying the descending chain condition are known
as Artinian ones. The ascending chain condition, the requirement that all ideals be finitely generated and
that every ideal contain a maximal element are criteria that are satisfied by Noetherian ones of these. .
Commutative examples of these objects have no zero divisors and are called integral domains, of which
fields are a subset. For 10 points, identify these algebraic structures exemplified by the integers which
unlike groups consist of a set and two binary operations, usually addition and multiplication.
ANSWER: rings
The use of this concept often requires the use of a "scoreboard" to prevent hazards that result in
stalling. Implementations employing this paradigm rely on restricting data movement to load and
store(*) operations and employ a fixed-length rather than a variable length format. A namesake 5stage (*) pipeline is designed to increase the number of instructions that machines employing it can execute
and processors employing this architecture assume that operands are contained in the internal registers
rather than memory, unlike their counterparts which do not impose this restriction. Examples of this
architecture include the SPARC processor as well as the MIPS architecture developed at Stanford. For ten
points, identify this processor architecture which relies on a smaller number of basic commands than its
counterpart, the CISC architecture.
ANSWER: RISC or Reduced Instruction Set Computer (accept pipeline before *)
Cardano's method is used to find these, and Vieta's formulas give results for summing and multiplying over
all of these values. Repeatedly subtracting the quotient of a function and its derivative is used in Newton's
Method for approximating these. Another formula for finding these involves the discriminant "b squared
minus 4ac." The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra says that a polynomial of order n has n of these, and for
order two polynomials, they can be found with the quadratic formula. For 10 points, name these values that
when input to a polynomial result in an output of zero.
ANSWER: polynomial roots [accept zeros before it is read]
Niels Abel showed there was no general way to find these values when the order is five or more. For
quadratic equations, there are no real instances of these if the discriminant is negative. The number of
positive or negative real ones can be bounded by Descartes' rule of signs. The fundamental theorem of
algebra states all non-constant complex polynomials has at least one complex one of these. They can be
found for quadratic equations by factoring or by using the quadratic equation. For 10 points, name these
values for a polynomial that make the expression equal to zero.
ANSWER: roots [or solutions; or zeroes before mentioned]
One computational robust algorithm for doing this has no shift, fixed shift, and variable shift stages.
For complex values, the Lehmer-Schur algorithm does this. In addition to the Jenkins-Traub method,
a common false position approach is Ridder's algorithm. Using Horner scheme to quickly evaluate a
polynomial via synthetic division and Rufini's algorithm to deflate the polynomial is helpful in this
task. Laguerre's method can do this for polynomial, but in general this can be achieved by a (*) fixed
point method where the function and its derivative are subtracted from the function variable. The simplest
method is based on the intermediate value theorem and repeatedly divides and interval in half to see where
the function changes sign. For 10 points, name this task that can be achieved by bisection method and
Newton's method and involves finding where a function is equal to zero.

Wilkinson's polynomial was formulated to show the problem of doing this action, while Edmund
Laguerre provided an exact solution for this task. The false position method will do this action, as
will the Secant method and splitting the circle method. More simply, the Abel-Ruffini Theorem
expresses impossibility of doing this with higher-order polynomials, but for polynomials of degree 2,
it can be done by completing the square, or using a certain formula. For ten points, name this process in
which the zeros to a polynomial are sought.
ANSWER: Root-Finding accept stuff like finding the zeros of an equation
Brent's method combines three algorithms for this process, one of which is inverse quadratic
interpolation. A finite difference method for this process has order of convergence equal to the
golden ratio and was generalized to multiple dimensions by Broyden. A cubic algorithm for this
process is the second member of a class derived from the Pade approximation; that class is named for
Householder and its first member is equivalent to inverting a first order Taylor expansion. For
polynomials, this process is equivalent to factorization, and for general function this can be performed using
the Newton Raphson method of sliding along the tangent line. For 10 points, name this process which
results in the solution to the equation F of X equals zero.

A particularly difficult example of performing this action was illustrated by James Wilkinson, and
the number of outputs for this action within a given interval is given by Budan's theorem. Several
methods of performing this action are outgrowths of Vincent's theorem, including the VAS method
used by Mathematica. Several different methods of doing this relies on a combination of finding the
Sturm sequence and counting the number of (*) sign changes within it. One common method of
performing this action involves repeatedly iterating x sub n plus one equals x sub n minus f of x sub n over f
prime of x sub n; that method repeatedly finds the x-intercept of a tangent line. For 10 points, name this task
done via Newton's method, which consists of finding the points at which the graph of a polynomial
intersects the x-axis.
ANSWER: finding the roots of a polynomial [or solving a polynomial, or finding the zeros of a polynomial; accept equivalents]
A debate between Tartaglia and Ferrari was prompted by a paper by Girolamo Cardano explaining
how to find these objects. The Abel-Ruffini Theorem states that no general process exists for finding
these objects given a quintic equation, and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees that an nth
degree polynomial has exactly n of them. They can sometimes be found by factoring a polynomial or,
with quadratic polynomials, by using the quadratic formula. For 10 points, name these solutions to an
equation stating that a polynomial is equal to zero.

IOCTL commands. The best ones issue commands like "cli" and "out" to writes to a hardware port,
made possible because they run on (*) Ring 0 on Intel x86 processors. One called Blue Pill could serve as
a hypervisor and was only detectable if there were flaws in virtualization code. Comparing low level and
operating system calls run from a read-only CD before startup to the same calls on the actual machine is the
most reliable way to detect them. For 10 points, name these types of malware that grant the namesake high

ANSWER: Rootkits
Symmetric matrices identical to the identity except at two diagonal and two off-diagonal positions
cause this transformation; those matrices are named for Givens and see use in Jacobi's algorithm for
eigenvalues. In the complex plane, this transformation can be achieved by the action of members of
the unitary group of degree 1, or by multiplication by complex (*) exponentials. Axial vectors pick up a
minus sign under the composition of one of these transformations with a reflection. In two dimensions,
multiplication by a matrix consisting of cosines and sines corresponds to this transformation. For 10 points,
identify this type of transformation that moves a question through a fixed angle.
ANSWER: rotation
In R3, the sum of these operations is specified using SO(3). One operation of this type transforms
a problem in Minkowski space to one in Euclidean space by replacing imaginary parts with real
parts; that type is named for Wick. Slerping is a process of interpolating unit quaternions that are
used in representing this action. Any displacement of a rigid question with one fixed point is one of these
(*) transformations. In 2D, this operation is performed using a 2 by 2 matrix with entries cosine, negative
sine, sine, cosine. Gabriel's horn is generated by taking the equation y equals one over x and performing
this action with respect to the x-axis. For 10 points, name this mathematical operation of revolving a
geometric entity around a given axis.
ANSWER: rotation [or revolution before "revolving" is read; accept any word forms]
In Euclidean spaces of n dimensions, this operation is represented by the special orthogonal group of order
n. Along with translations and boosts, operations of this kind make up the Lorentz group of special
relativity. In quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operator is the generator of the infinitesimal
operations of this kind. The plane of polarization will undergo this action in light propagating along a
magnetic field, and for a rigid question, any action of this type can be decomposed into three actions of this
kind performed with respect to the Euler angles. In two dimensions, performing this operation by some
angle theta involves multiplying by a matrix whose four entries are cosine-theta, sine-theta, minus-sinetheta, and cosine-theta. For 10 points, identify this operation which involves displacing an object along an
angular, rather than a linear coordinate.
ANSWER: rotation
The Wick type of this process multiplies the temporal dimension by i in order to make Minkowski
space look Euclidean. The Lorentz group includes these transformations and boosts, and one Lie
group representation of them is the group SO(3). An asymmetric rigid question has six degrees of
freedom: three from translation and three from this transformation. Euler angles describe this
transformation. The (*) matrix for this transformation is [cosine x, negative sine x; sine x, cosine x] in 2D.
This transformation preserves the length of a vector. For 10 points, name this transformation that turns an
object around a point.
ANSWER: rotation
The space of all operations that correspond to these motions is called SO(3). Phasors can be interpreted as
vectors undergoing this motion. Gradients of scalar fields do not do this, as evidenced by the vanishment of
the curl operator on those vector fields. Any motion of this type can be decomposed into three orthogonal
uniaxial motions, perhaps using Euler angles, or by specifying the yaw, pitch, and roll. In spherical
coordinates, these motions correspond to those in which the radius coordinate is unchanged. Where this
motion exists, angular momentum is nonzero. For 10 points, name this type of motion in which a question
moves about an axis but not along it.
ANSWER: rotation [accept circulation; or word forms; do not accept "circular motion"]
In numerical algorithms, machine epsilon measures the degree to which this operation affects the outcome
of floating-point operations, and the degree to which the resulting errors are amplified is described by the
condition number. For a variable x, x minus this function of x yields a sawtooth wave. To express an
arbitrary-precision number using a given number of significant digits, one must perform this operation. One
form of it is written using square brackets with the bottom part removed and is called "ceiling". For 10
points, name this operation, contrasted with truncation, in which a number is approximated by a less-precise
number, and which might convert 3.7 to 4.

One source of failure in doing this action can be mitigated by poisoned reverse. One low complexity
way of doing this is called hot potato. Data structures used in doing this can be compacted through
aggregation based on (*) CIDR. Accomplishing this between autonomous systems is aided by BGP. This
is an application of an algorithm that iteratively adds the unfinalized node with minimum metric to a set of
finished nodes. That link state algorithm is known as Dijkstra's algorithm and contrasts with distance vector
approaches. To accomplish this, a namesake table is created with columns like mask, interface, and
gateway. The entries in that table will have MAC or IP addresses corresponding to destinations. For 10

named devices made by companies like Netgear and Cisco.
ANSWER: routing
This algorithm is often paired with OAEP, which makes it probabilistic by adding random oracles. Now
implemented via the PCKS scheme, modern versions use the Carmichael function. One pair of values
generated have a product congruent to 1 modulo lambda of n. One step involves computing the totient of
the product of two numbers and finding an integer that is coprime to that result. Another step in this
algorithm is to find the modular multiplicative inverse of e, and the efficacy of this algorithm is proven by
Fermat's Little Theorem. Its secure because of the difficulty in factoring large primes. For 10 points, name

ANSWER: RSA encryption [or Rivest, Shamir and Adleman]
A 1990 paper by M. J. Wiener showed that it could be made more efficient by using values like F0,
F2, and F4, while PSS implementations are typically less favored over the PKCS#1.15
implementation of it. Another way to implement this algorithm, discouraged by (*) ANSI X9.31, sets
the two highest and one lowest bits of a number, and increments by two until the Rabin-Miller test returns
true. Its speed is increased with a quintuple storing information like the coefficient of the Chinese
Remainder Theorem. Its key step computes an exponent, e, from the product of two large prime numbers.
For 10 points, name this public-key encryption method, named for its three formulators.
ANSWER: RSA Encryption [or Rivest-Shamir-Aldeman Encryption]
To ensure the correctness of one of the inputs to this procedure, the Miller-Rabin or Solovay-Strassen tests
were used, though they have recently been superseded by the AKS criterion. An improved version of this
procedure was invented by Rabin and requires the use of redundancy to disambiguate between four possible
outcomes. This algorithm can be defeated if Dixon's algorithm or the quadratic sieve or the elliptic curve
algorithm are successful. This algorithm employs the Chinese remainder theorem to compute congruences
modulo the product of two large primes to both encode a message using a public key and decode it using a
private one. For 10 points, identify this encryption procedure whose security is based on the difficulty of
factoring large integers, named for its three discoverers.

In asymptotic analysis, a method sometimes named for these locations generalizes Laplace's method
for non-oscillatory complex contour integrals. That method considers the dominant contribution to
the integral to occur at the boundaries or at these locations. In a zero-sum two player game, locations
of this type are (*) Nash equilibria. They are the focus of the method of steepest descent and these
locations are often described as mountain passes connecting valleys in one direction with peaks on either
side. If the determinant of the Hessian is negative, then one of these points results by the second derivative
test. In one dimension, a stationary inflection point is, for 10 points, what kind of critical point that isn-t a
local maximum or minimum, but where the first derivative is zero?
ANSWER: saddle points
These points exist where the Hessian determinant of a function is negative, which is the determinant of the
matrix of second partial derivatives. Contour lines seem to cross each other at these points, and one of these
points can be found on a hyperbolic paraboloid. Name these points on surfaces in threedimensions
characterized by zero first derivatives which increase in some directions and decrease in others.
ANSWER: saddle points
The basis for most modern approaches to this problem is the DPLL algorithm. A nearly identicallyposed PSPACE-complete problem is TQBF. By considering a tableau of sequential Turing-machine

Rabin and Karp give their names to a "fuzzy" one of these, useful in the detection of plagiarism. The
Galil rule was an important optimization for the commonly used Boyer-Moore type, while the oft-
used Knuth-Morris-Pratt one performs this operation on a set of strings. The efficiency of quantum

One algorithm for performing this operation in square-root-of-N time initializes the system into N states
with equal probability distributions, applies a diffusion transform, and samples the resulting superposed
state. Another algorithm to perform this operation has time of order equal to number of edges plus number
of vertices and marks each node in a graph with a discovery and finishing time as it travels the maximum
distance down a graph branch before retracing its steps. For a sorted list, this operation can be performed in
logarithmic time by recursively subdividing the list into halves and eliminating half of the items. It can also
be performed in linear time by sequentially checking the key against every element in the target list. For 10

Boolean query and pressing the "I-m Feeling Lucky" button on an engine such as Google.
ANSWER: searching
One method of doing this process introduced by Jack Kiefer takes into account non-uniform memory access

Grover and takes big O of square root of n time. Poor implementations of one algorithm fail for large sets,
as adding two interval endpoints then dividing by two can give an overflow error. For ordered lists it can be
completed in big O of log n time, while the best general algorithm takes big O of n time as it requires
looking at each element. For 10 points, identify this process that has "linear" and "binary" versions used to

One of these entities used to model functions that are analytic within an annulus is named after Laurent. The
Weierstrass M-, ratio, and comparison tests are used to analyze the behavior of these mathematical entities,
and functions of a real variable can be modeled with varieties of these named after Maclaurin and Taylor.
Some alternating ones are said to converge conditionally, and divergent ones of these include the harmonic

geometric, the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence.
ANSWER: infinite series
Abel's test and Dirichlet's test are both used when analyzing these mathematical entities, as is the
Weierstrass M-test. The difference between one of them and the natural logarithm defines the EulerMascheroni constant. Leibniz defined one that gives pi divided by four while the Maclaurin one is
used to represent functions. The ratio test is used on them by taking the limit of the n+1 term divided
by the n term. These entities can possess absolute or uniform convergence and they are denoted using an
uppercase sigma with the starting point on the bottom and the ending point on the top. For 10 points, name

A branch of mathematics that deals with these things was developed by Georg Cantor. The number of
elements in one of these is its cardinality. One of them that contains all those that are not members of
themselves leads to a contradiction in Russell's paradox. A backslash is used to represent the complement
of two of these things while an "O" with a slash through it represents the empty one. For 10 points, name
these mathematical collections that can be subject to union or intersection.
ANSWER: sets
Two groups of axioms for handling these entities are Kripke-Platek and Zermelo Fraenkel. When these are
created from a countable number of operations, they are named after Emile Borel, and under certain
circumstances these entities can be a ring. One of these can be combined with two operations to form a field
or with one operation to form a group. The universal example includes all objects within the given axioms,
including possibly itself, while the complement of one of these entities includes everything except what is in
that entity. Name these unordered lists which can be combined using union or intersection.
ANSWER: sets
In the study of these objects, the technique of forcing can be used to prove independence, while one
theorem states that any of these can be given a well-ordering. One statement about these says that the
Cartesian product of non-empty ones is non-empty, and the "power" one of these has higher cardinality than
the underlying one of these. One named after Cantor is formed by recursively removing the middle thirds of
intervals, and they often are studied using Zermelo-Frankel axioms, which do not include the axiom of
choice. For 10 points, identify these mathematical objects which can be combined using unions and
intersections and are collections of distinct objects.
ANSWER: sets
These objects form the von Neumann Universe, and the Axiom of Choice can be used to show that these
objects can always be well-ordered. These objects are described by axioms of Zermelo and Fraenkel. An
example made up of these objects which do not contain themselves is the core of Russell's Paradox. One of
these objects is called countable if there is a one-to-one function to the natural numbers with it as the
domain. Symmetric difference is an operation on these objects, which are more commonly operated on by
intersection and union. For ten points, name these mathematical collections of elements.
ANSWER: set
One way to define equality for two of these things is the axiom of extensionality. Operations on these
entities include the Cartesian product, which combines these entities to make one of these comprising
ordered pairs. A notation used to "build" these entities uses a vertical line or colon that is read as
"such that". The number of elements in one of these entities is its cardinality. Relationships between
these entities can be shown with a Venn diagram, and their operations include union and intersection.
Name these collections whose elements are listed between curly braces.
ANSWER: sets
Pairs of these things are subject to the Axiom of pairing, which in turn is subject to the Axiom schema of
replacement. A commonly used set of axioms for handling these was developed by Abraham Fraenkel
[FRANE-kul] and Ernst Zermelo. The quantity commonly thought of as their size is called cardinality.

ANSWER: seven
The discovery of exotic spheres of this dimension earned John Milnor the 2011 Abel prize. This number,
the smallest double Mersenne prime, is also the fewest number of sides of a regular polygon that cannot be

Zhan and Noon tested algorithms for solving this problem, finding approximate or double bucket
modifications to one algorithm and Pallattino's algorithm with two queues were fastest on actual data.
Johnson's algorithm solves this problem in the sparse case faster than the cubic Floyd's algorithm, both of
which solve this for all pairs. Another approach uses dynamic programming, and checks all edges n times;
that algorithm also detects negative cost cycles, and is named for Bellman and Ford. A Fibonacci heap is
used to speed up a greedy approach, which works only for positive-weight edges, while if an admissible

Methods that rely on additional key-value information include radix and bucket varieties of this
algorithm. Susan Merritt grouped these algorithms as either easy split/hard join or hard split/easy
join, but Knuth's tradition taxonomy of these algorithms is based on their fundamental operation-insertion, exchange, or selection. One inefficient algorithm of this type (*) compares every pair of
items, and another choose a pivot then calls itself recursively on each half--those examples are called
bubble and quick. For 10 points, name this class of algorithm which may use a comparator to order a list.
ANSWER: Sorting Algorithms [accept word forms and logical equivalents]
Compared to other types of this procedure, one type of it performs better the closer it is to completion,
scaling from big O of N squared to big O of N . The shell type of this procedure improves on that previous
insertion type. The last element of the partition is sometimes chosen as the (*) pivot position in a type of
this procedure that uses a "divide-and-conquer" and recursive algorithm; that type is named for its speed.
One of these procedures allows elements to "rise" to the top by comparing them and appropriately swapping
them based on their values. There are bubble and quick types of, for 10 points, what computer science
procedure in which a list is placed in order?
ANSWER: sorting algorithm
The radix and bucket variety of this algorithm can have better run time than other types, and the bogo
variety is of the order of n factorial. The selection and insertion varieties are worse in general than one that
is named after a data structure that always allows access to the smallest element, a heap. One type involves
the splitting of an array into two and then performing the titular operation recursively. For 10 points, merge
and quick name what class of algorithms that output an ordered list or array.
ANSWER: sorting algorithms
Fast methods for performing this function operate in O(n log n) (read: big "oh" of n log n) time, and
include the "merge" and "binary tree" methods. The most common method to do this steps through an array,
interchanging adjacent elements repeatedly until no changes are made on one full trip, called the "bubble"
method. For 10 points, name this common operation, the act of interchanging members of a list until they
are
in a pre-defined order.
ANSWER: sorting
The spread type of these algorithms was invented in 2002 by Steven Ross and is similar to both the bucket
and radix type. One of these algorithm has best, average, and worst case run times of n log n; that one
repeatedly removes the root of a heap. One of these methods divides an array in half recursively and utilizes
a pivot value, while another compares two adjacent elements and switches them if needed. Those methods
are, respectively, the quick and bubble types. For 10 points, name these algorithms, including the selection
and insertion varieties, that arrange elements in a specific order.
ANSWER: sorting algorithms [accept spreadsort, heapsort, quicksort, or bubble sort]
One of these uses a positional notation and processes individual digits, and is called "radix." Another one of
these uses a namesake data structure and the operations of insertion and root deletion, and is the "heap"
type. Another one repeatedly steps through a dataset, swapping adjacent pairs of elements if they are in the
wrong order, and is named "bubble," and a more famous one was invented by Tony Hoare and is called
"quick." For 10 points, name this class of algorithms, whose members order the elements of a given set.
ANSWER: sorting algorithms
Random permutations of the objects involved in this process are generated until the correct
permutation is found in the bogo type of this process. If the values of the elements involved come
from a known finite set like the integers, then the radix one of these processes is appropriate. Other
methods include a divide-and-conquer algorithm using a pivot value, and, in another type of this
process, "rabbits" are put in the correct place very quickly, while "turtles" find their way through the list
slowly. For 10 points, quick and bubble are types of which algorithms that arrange the elements of a list in
ascending or descending order.
ANSWER: sorting algorithms [accept bogosort before "bogo" is read]
In the programming languages Perl and Python, this process can be performed using the Schwartzian
transform. An algorithm for this process developed by Dijkstra [DIKE-stra] is named for the smooth
transition between its best and worst case performance. One type of this process can be performed from the
most significant digit to the least significant digit. Donald Shell developed a comparison algorithm to
perform this process, and Tony Hoare developed a divide and conquer algorithm to "quickly" perform this
process that involves selecting a pivot. For 10 points, name this process in which items are rearranged and
placed in a specific order.
ANSWER: sorting [or quicksort; or radix sort; or shellsort; or smoothsort, etc.]
One asymptotically optimal method for performing this in hardware is named for Ajtai, Komlos, and
Szemeredi, while Leonardo numbers underlie an adaptive method known as the "smooth" variety.
For certain kinds of data, algorithms like the "pigeonhole" and "bucket" forms can outperform the
otherwise-optimal big O of (*) n log n. One method for doing this named for the data structure which it
uses improves on one which involves scanning repeatedly for the next element; those are the "heap" and
"selection" varieties. Exemplified by algorithms like "insertion", "merge", "quick", and "bubble", for 10
points, name this task in computer programming in which a list is put in order.
ANSWER: sorting
In Perl, this process is helped along by the Schwartzian Transform. The "bogo" type of it will randomly
shuffle a set however many times it takes to successfully accomplish this action. C.A.R. Hoare invented a
way to accomplish it that involves a divide-and-conquer algorithm and the selection of a pivot element and
which runs in big O of n log n time. "Quick" and "bubble" are two algorithms that accomplish, for 10
points, what process in computer science that involves the ordering of items in a list?
ANSWER: sorting [accept word forms]
One particularly fast method for this process is called "radix." Another algorithm for it repeatedly finds
pivots to subdivide a set and was invented by Hoare ("HORE"). The time required by this process is judged
by how many times the values of two elements need to be compared. Less efficient methods require
n-squared steps; those include the "bubble" algorithm for this, which is named for the way elements rise
through a list. For 10 points, name this procedure, which puts the elements of a data structure in order.
ANSWER: sorting algorithms
Least significant digit and most significant digit are two examples of the radix instance in this class of
algorithms. One algorithm in this class constructs a heap, adds elements to it, maintaining the heap
property, and then removes them one by one. Many examples of this class of algorithms are
divide-and-conquer, including one that reorders an input around a pivot. That one is C.A.R. Hoare's "quick"
example. A commonly taught one compares two adjacent elements and switches them if necessary; that is
the bubble one. For 20 points, identify this class of algorithms that puts a list in order.
ANSWER: sorting algorithms
Geffert extended this theorem to show that there exist unary languages described by this theorem.
The original proof of this theorem used a language defined as the set of inputs that a Turing machine
does not accept before visiting a certain number of cells. One corollary of this theorem is that L is a
strict subset of the class that contains the quantified Boolean formulas problem. One form of it
applies to functions f for which there exists a deterministic Turing machine that halts after visiting a
number of cells on its tape equal to f of the size of the input. Those functions are constructible in the
sense required by this theorem. Formally, this theorem holds that (*) "SPACE of little-o of f of n" is a

One of these objects results from compactifying the union of infinity and the complex numbers; that
one, equivalent to the extended complex plane, is named for Riemann. The homeomorphic relation
between simply connected, closed 3-manifolds and a type of these was shown in Grigori Perelman's
proof of the Poincare conjucture. A lack of Lebesgue measure in fragments of these helps resolve the

The ratio of x to y obtained from Pell's equation gives an approximation of this function of n. This
function of x is equivalent to e to the quantity one-half times the natural log of x. The Babylonian
method, or Heron's method, is one way to compute this function. The first known irrational number
was this function of (*) two. This function of negative one yields i. The distance formula uses a sum of
squares and this function. For 10 points, name this function which yields y when y squared is input.
ANSWER: square root [do not accept or prompt on "square"]
An algorithm to compute this function pairs up digits and looks like long division. This function
is applied to 2 pi in the denominator of the standard normal distribution. If a complex number is
in polar form, one step in performing this function on the number is to divide the angle by two.
Applying this function to the variance of data gives the standard deviation. Its graph is the upper
half of a rightward-opening parabola. This function is applied to the sum of the squares of the legs
of a right triangle to calculate the hypotenuse. Name this function, equivalent to raising a number
to the one-half power, that is expressed using a radical.
ANSWER: square roots [accept raising to the one-half power before "raising"; prompt on radical]
Viete's formula for two over pi uses the iterated composition of this operation. The
Bhaskara-Brouncker algorithm and the Babylonian method compute this operation. Newton's
method applied to the formula "x squared plus c" finds this (*) function for c. The geometric mean of a
and b is this operation applied to a times b. When this operation is applied to negative one, the result is i.
For 10 points, name this operation on a number n, that returns the number m such that m squared is n.
ANSWER: square root
To apply this function to a complex number p+qi, set a2-b2 equal to p and 2ab equal to q. An algorithm to
calculate this function for decimal numbers pairs up digits in the input number, and evaluating this function
for a complex number represented as a vector involves dividing the angle of that vector by two. Applying
the squaring function to a real number and then this function has the net effect of finding the absolute value.
Its graph is half of a rightward opening parabola. Name this function which takes an input of two and gives
an output equal to approximately 1.414.
ANSWER: square root (accept raise to the 1/2 power or equivalent, prompt on "root" or "radical", do not accept "square")
The first proof that this number is irrational is believed to have been produced by Hippasus, a student of
Pythagoras, but it was thrown overboard by the Pythagoreans. Also known as Pythagoras' constant, it is the
geometric mean of one-half and four. It is also equal to the secant of forty-five degrees, which means it is the
length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose two legs each measure one unit. For 10 points, identify
this number, approximately equal to 1.414, and the only solution to the equation "x squared minus two
equals zero."
ANSWER: square root of 2 [or radical 2]
Two necessary but not sufficient conditions for one form of this property are that all coefficients of an sdomain characteristic equation have the same sign and be non-zero. If those were satisfied one would
compute a Routh-Hurwitz array, but, if not, one would know that there are roots in the right half of the splane. If the unit circle is in the region of convergence of a transfer function and all poles are inside the unit
circle, an LTI system has causality and this property. If the impulse response of an LTI system is absolutely
summable, then the system has its BIBO form. For a linear system described by the equation x-dot equals f
of x comma t, an equilibrium point x-star has one form of this property if all solutions starting near x-star
stay near x-star forever; that form is named for Lyapunov. For 10 points, name this property of systems
characterized by robustness to small changes in initial conditions.
ANSWER: stability [accept word forms]
Rbp stores a pointer to the base of one of these, and they can be exploited via buffer overflow. This data
structure is used to perform the depth-first search algorithm and variables are stored on either the heap or
one of these. It has a first in last out structure and in java, methods it has include push and pop. Only the last
element inserted can be retrieved from it. For 10 points, too many recursive calls can overflow what type of
data structure sometimes contrasted with a queue.
ANSWER: stack [accept call stack before "methods"]
In the shunting-yard algorithm, function tokens are inserted into this type of data structure. A
finite-state machine and this component comprise a push-down automaton. In contrast to heap-based
allocation, this type of memory allocation is quicker and usually automatic, though misuse of it can
lead to an overflow. A common way of debugging a program is to trace the callers of a subroutine
stored in this structure. The disks in the (*) Towers of Hanoi problem are stored in this type of data
structure. Elements of this container class can be inserted by pushing and subsequently removed by
popping. For 10 points, name this last-in, first-out data structure that is often contrasted with a queue.
ANSWER: stacks
The use of a computation model containing one of these elements allows one to prove the version of
the pumping lemma that replicates two sections of a string in parallel. A deterministic finite
automaton with two of these elements is equivalent to a Turing machine, while the set of context free
languages can be recognized by a DFA with one of these modifications, a model known as a PDA.
Allocating memory in a region with this name relies on its namesake (*) frames and is contrasted with
dynamic memory allocation, which uses the heap. The data structure of this name supports operations like
"peek", which looks at the top element without removing it. For 10 points, name this data structure which
uses operations like "push" and "pop" to support last-in first-out access.
ANSWER: stacks
In C, the alloca keyword allocates space on this thing, which is thus automatically freed when the
function returns to its caller. Every function call reserves a frame, or activation record, on this thing,
which is where the function's local variables are stored unless they are allocated using malloc, in
which case they are stored on the heap. Big O of n space is required on it by recursive functions -
with n the depth of recursive calls - but that can be reduced to big O of one by implementing tail
recursion, thus avoiding a common (*) "overflow". The first-taught way to make depth-first search
non-recursive is to use this data structure. Reverse Polish notation is conceptualized using it. Insertion and
deletion in it is called push and pop, respectively. For 10 points, name this last-in first-out data structure that
contrasts with the first-in first-out queue.
ANSWER: stack
The shunting-yard algorithm evaluates operators using this structure, which helps reduce memory
access by leaving operators at the end of operands, a format known as reverse Polish notation. The
x87 floating point architecture organizes 8 registers into this structure that uses FXCH instructions
to swap registers, although it may still encounter its namesake (*) "overflows" common to flat registers.
One method to inspect but not modify these structures is the peek operation, although they fundamentally
run by push and pop from the top. For ten points, identify these last-in-first-out data structures.
ANSWER: stack
Reverse Polish notation uses this data structure for memory storage. The language PostScript is said to be
oriented to these data structures, which are not found in Python because, in that language, two of this
structure's key operations can be implemented on any list. These restricted data structures, which were first
proposed by Frederich Bauer, are typically implemented through a singly linked list or through a to-do box.
To add or remove data to these structures, the "push" or "pop" operation can be used. For 10 points, name
this last-in, first-out data structure.
ANSWER: stacks
This structure is the form in which local variables, function parameters and other non-explicitly
allocated data are stored in memory. The call one of these structures contains frames that control program
flow; a common debugging method "traces" that one. A depth-first search uses this structure, unlike a
breadth-first search. The operations push and pop operate on this data structure. For 10 points, identify this
last-in first-out data structure.
ANSWER: stack
Languages that support continuation often employ the "spaghetti" form of these entities. Entities
of this name can use canaries to check for unexpected values. Attacks on those entities employ
smashing, and they can be both wound and unwound. Those entities of this name contain data like
the (*) return address and a function's local variables. A data structure of this name was used to store data
in calculators that used reverse Polish notation. Along with the heap, it's where data is stored. This is also
the name of a data structure that supports push and pop operations. For 10 points, give this name for a data
structure that, unlike a queue, operates on a "last in, first out" principle.
ANSWER: stacks
Donald Knuth showed that a permutation can be sorted with one of these data structures if and only if it
does not contain the pattern "two three one". In C-based languages, memory allocation at runtime takes
place in the heap and in this data structure, and they are implemented in reverse Polish notation for
calculations. Some variants of this data structure make use of an operation to "peek" at the top element,
although there are only two essential operations, one which adds an element to the top and the other which
removes the top element; those operations are push and pop. For ten points, name this last-in-first-out data
structure.
ANSWER: stack (accept last-in-first-out or LIFO before mentioned)
An algorithm that uses this data structure can be used to do a topological sort and has an iterative
deepening form. Divide and conquer algorithms can be implemented iteratively using one of these,
and the alternative to heap-based memory allocation is based on one of these. They are used to
implement Reverse Polish notation calculations as well as the aforementioned (*) depth-first search,
and their fundamental operations are push and pop. For 10 points, name this last-in, first-out data
structure, in which adds and removes both occur on the "top."
ANSWER: stacks
In C++, the keyword "this" is a pointer stored in a data structure of this type. An overflow for named this
type of data structure if the "call" one has its memory overused. The elements of it can be pushed and pop,
and they operate under the "last in, first out" paradigm. For 10 points, name this "vertical" counterpart to
the queue.
ANSWER: stack
Expressions in postfix notation can be evaluated using one of these structures, while infix
expressions require two of them. This data structure can be implemented with a linked list and a
pointer to one end of the list. Commands issued by a computer program are stored on the "call" type.
They may (*) overflow if too much information is stored in them. They use the "push" and "pop"
operations to add and remove elements. For 10 points, name this last in, first out data structure, often
contrasted with a queue.
ANSWER: stacks
Canaries can help detect smashing operations against an entity of this name. This type of data structure is
used to perform the backtracking steps in depth-first searches and can easily support operations on a reverse
Polish notation calculator. Infinite recursion can cause an entity of this name to overflow. When this data
structure is implemented with a singly-linked list, the head of the linked list is removed in the pop operation,
unlike a pop operation on a queue. For 10 points, name this last-in, first-out data structure.
ANSWER: call stacks
Inspection of this data structure is a security mechanism implemented by the JVM to accommodate
untrusted code. A data structure of this type is used to store information about subroutines of a process.
That structure can be subject to an overflow when recursion is used and is prefixed by the word call. This
data structure can be used to easily reverse the order of a set. The push and pop operations are performed
on this data structure. For 10 points, name this last in first out data structure contrasted with a queue.
ANSWER: stack
Activation frames are stored in this type of data structure. Adding and removing those frames is called
winding and unwinding, respectively, and this stores memory concerning a program's subroutines.
Programs such as Java have a "peek" function which allows the top value in one of these structures to be
accessed without being removed. The most basic operations on this structure are "push" and "pop." For 10
points, name this last-in-first-out data structure.
ANSWER: stack [or call stack]
A set of corporate practices developed by Motorola and practiced by 3M and Raytheon, among
others, is named for this, implying exceptional quality and almost no manufacturing defects. The socalled empirical rule, or 68-95-99.7 rule, relates area to distance, which is expressed in terms of this
quantity. The z-score is computed by subtracting mu from the individual raw score, then dividing the
difference by this (*) number, in a process known as normalization. For the Wechsler IQ test it is 15, while
for the Stanford-Binet it is 16. It is the root mean square of the differences between each data point and the
arithmetic mean. Also defined as the square root of the variance, it is denoted by the Greek letter sigma.
FTP, in statistics, this is a measure of the spread of values in a random variable or a probability distribution.
ANSWER: standard deviation (prompt on "sigma" before it is mentioned and prompt on "six sigma" before "empirical rule")
The probability of a random variable differing from its mean by more than this value is given by
Chebyshev's theorem. This quantity divided by the mean equals the coefficient of variation. Z-values are
expressed in units of this value from the mean. This quantity divided by the square root of the sample size
equals the standard error. For a normal distribution, around 68% of values lie within this value of the mean.
Symbolized by a lowercase sigma, this value is equal to the square root of the variance. For 10 points, name
this measure of variation in a distribution.
ANSWER: standard deviation
Mean difference is divided by this quantity to calculate Cohen's d, which measures effect size. This
quantity equals the square root of the quantity number of trials times probability of success times
probability of failure for a binomial distribution. It is squared in the denominator of Chebyshev's
inequality, which guarantees at least a certain number of values close to the mean of a distribution.
This quantity is multiplied by the square root of two pi in a denominator to normalize the (*)
Gaussian distribution. The difference between a score and the mean is divided by this quantity to calculate
z-scores. It equals the square root of the expected value of the quantity score minus mean, quantity squared.
For 10 points, name this square root of variance.
ANSWER: standard deviation
Chebyshev's inequality states that 1 divided by n squared, where n is this measure, will give the
percentage of values that exceed this quantity. The correlation coefficient times the y values of this
measure over the x values of this measure gives the slope of a regression line. The empirical rule
states that (*) sixty-eight percent of a normal data distribution will fall within one of these, while to find a
z-score one subtracts the average from a given value and divides by this quantity. For 10 points, give this
name for the square root of variance, a measure that indicates how spread out data is.
ANSWER: standard deviation
The slope of a regression equation is the correlation coefficient times the quotient of this value of the y
variables over this value of the x variables. This value for adding or subtracting the values of two samples
can be found by adding these values from the two samples in quadrature. A z-score for a finding the
likelihood of people at least a certain distance away from the mean can be calculated by taking the distance
from the mean over this value of the distribution. For ten points, name this measure of how separated the
data are, the square root of the variance.
ANSWER: standard deviation
An approximate unbiased estimator for this quantity is given by a "one over n minus 1.5" estimator.
It is invariant to change of location and scales directly with change of scale. Chebyshev's inequality
links the distribution function to this quantity for arbitrary distributions, and the stronger "empirical
rule" can be used for normally distributed data. Unlike a related measure of dispersion, it takes the same
units as the data it describes. For ten points, identify this quantity that for discrete distributions is the rootmean-square distance of values from the mean, the square root of the variance.
ANSWER: Standard Deviation
This statement provides the duality between the homology of chains and the de Rahm
cohomology. This statement can be used to show that the codifferential is the adjoint of the
exterior derivative when considering the Hodge dual on manifolds. This statement is used to
generate a contradiction when smoothly retracting a ball onto its boundary in the proof of the
Brouwer fixed point theorem. The most general form of this statement relates the integral of the
exterior derivative of a differential form over some manifold to its integral over the boundary of
the same manifold. For a planar curve, this result reduces to Green's theorem. For 10 points,
name this theorem from vector calculus, which states that the surface integral of the curl of a
function dotted with the normal is equal to the line integral of the function around a boundary of
the surface.
ANSWER: Stokes's theorem
Two answers needed. The Poncelet-Steiner theorem states that one is unnecessary if you can use the other
one, and the Mohr-Mascheroni theorem says one of them is unnecessary. One can be used, along with
dividers, to create the Pythagorean extensions of the rationals. Considered in algebraic terms, they can only
produce constructible numbers, and as a result one cannot construct every regular polygon with them, nor
can one double the volume of a cube with them. One also cannot use them to find a square with the area of
a given circle, but with a quadratrix, one can trisect a curve with them. For 10 points, identify these two
mechanical devices used in classical Greek geometry.
ANSWER: straightedge and compass [prompt on "ruler" for straightedge; accept answers in either order]
The set of all of these variables that can exist over a set of symbols V is given by the Kleene
(clean) Star of V, and regular expressions are commonly used to manipulate these variables. The
"literal" type of these variables is created using bracket delimiters, and the trim function is used to
remove whitespace from them. They commonly use UTF-8 or ASCII (ASK-ee) encoding, and several
of them can be (*) joined together in concatenation. For 10 points, name these variables that are often used
to store sequences of symbols, especially text.
ANSWER: string
The Kleene star is a superset of data of this type. In FORTRAN, Hollerith notation is used to identify this
type of data. Regular expressions are used to match this type of data. Splitting these up based on a delimiter
is called tokenizing. In C, these are classified as either "byte" or "wide." When these are placed directly into
source code, they are called "literals". In Java, a plus sign is used to concatenate two of these together. Data
of this type is often set off by quotation marks. This type of data can be represented as an array of char data.
Parsing is used specifically on this kind of data, which may include prefixes and suffixes. For 10 points,
name this type of data which represents text.
ANSWER: strings [or characters; prompt on "text" or same-knowledge equivalents before mention]
The C functions that "copy" and "cat" these objects are particularly vulnerable to security errors. Common
functions that operate on these objects include "left", "trim" and "split". They can be searched by the
Rabin-Karp algorithm. It's not a hashcode or a clone, but every object in Java contains a method that
converts the object "to" one of these data structures. They can be searched with regular expressions, and in
C are stored in an array of characters ending with a null-terminator. For 10 points, name these data
structures which can be used to store text.
ANSWER: strings
These structures make up the set resulting from the Kleene Star of a set, and in a regular language all ones
of sufficient length can be pumped. Searches in them can be accomplished by the the Boyer-Moore or the
Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm. C-style ones are arrays terminated by a null and encoding methods include
EBDIC, Unicode, and ASCII. They can be concatenated, reversed, or made all uppercase or lowercase. For
10 points, name these computer science constructs which are made from a series of characters and contain
text.
ANSWER: strings
One algorithm for searching these variables creates a pair of shift tables, while another one generates a
rolling hash. In addition to the Boyer-Moore and Rabin-Karp algorithm, another method that uses partial
matches to search them generates a failure table and is named for Knuth, Morris, and Pratt. Prolog and
Erlang lack these variables entirely, which in modern systems can use the UTF-16 encoding system. The
trim function cuts spaces from these variables, which can also be acted on by the uppercase and lowercase
functions. FTP, name these variables that store text.
ANSWER: string
The languages awk and sed were developed specifically to manipulate these data types. One
algorithm implements a rolling hash to search for multiple target patterns in data of this type; that
algorithm is named for Rabin and Karp. In the C language, these are null-terminated. When these
data types appear explicitly in source code, they are called literal and might require escape sequences to
access certain characters. Regular expressions can be used to match these types of data, and each element
of one of these could be expressed in unicode. For 10 points, name this data type which represents a list of
characters, such as a name or phrase.
ANSWER: String [prompt on "patterns"]
Finite state automata accept languages, which are a set of these constructs. Regular expressions
work on these constructs. In Java, these constructs can be concatenated with a plus symbol. They are
terminated with a null character in C. Their printf format is a percent sign followed by a (*) s. They
are most often surrounded by double quotes when declared. For 10 points, identify this data type that
consists of a sequence of characters.
ANSWER: string
The Myhill-Nerode relation is defined on sets of these and a set of them is called a formal
language. C style ones are null terminated and search algorithms on them include Boyer-Moore and
the KMP algorithm. Combining two of them is called (*) concatenation and in some cases matching
them can be accomplished by regular expressions. Common encoding methods used include Unicode and
ASCII. For 10 points, name these sequences of characters used to store text on computers.
ANSWER: strings [prompt on words]
The size of the minimal description of one of these objects is known as its Kolmogorov complexity. In
C, these entities can be copied with a fixed size to prevent buffer overflow. They can be prefixed with their
length, or stored with a special terminating character at the end in the "null-terminated" variety present in
C. Operations on these data types include concatenation and checking whether they're empty. For 10 points,
name this data type that represents a sequence of characters.
ANSWER: strings
The number of changes needed to convert from one of these objects to another one is measured by
the Levenshtein distance. A set of these objects is generated by the Kleene star operation. These
objects are the inputs to the Knuth-Morris-Pratt and Rabin-Karp algorithms. P-examples of these
variables are length prefixed, while C-style examples of these variables are (*) null-terminated. Two of
them can be joined into one via concatenation. In C these variables are enclosed in double quotes during
declaration. In Linux, these variables can be searched using the "grep" operation. For 10 points, name this
data type consisting of a sequence of characters, which is often used to store text.
ANSWER: strings [prompt on "str"]
Definite finite automata accept a language, or set of these things. In C, these things are null-terminated,
and they are operated on by regular expressions. The most well-known example of an immutable object is
an instance of the class in Java known by this name. The constitutive elements of these things can be
encoded with ASCII or UTF-8. These things are joined end-to-end by concatenation. For 15 points, identify
this data type often implemented as an array of characters.
ANSWER: strings
On UNIX systems, sed and grep tools are used to work with files as if they were instances of this data
type. In programming languages like Java, the split method will break apart one of these into an array of
these. In C, these structures are null terminated. These objects can be matched or searched using regular
expressions. Individual units in this data type are encoded in ASCII (ASS-kee) or Unicode. For 10 points,
name this data type that is a sequence of characters.
ANSWER: string [or text until it is read]
The Weierstrass type of this process uses the function the tangent of the quantity x over two, and this type
of cipher is exemplified by the monoalphabetic cipher. This word refers to a type of integration method that
often uses hyperbolic or circular trigonometric functions depending on the integrand, though any function
can be used. This word also refers to a method for solving systems of equations that is easy to use when one
of the equations is in slope-intercept form. Name this term, sometimes referring to a type of transformation,
that is synonymous with replacement.
ANSWER: substitution
One statement proved in this construct is that any given set undergoing pairwise intersection with
other sets containing XYZ, XZ, or YZ must not contain Z. If, in this construct, each set in a collection
is reduced to two elements per set, then the collection is inconsistent, which results in a prohibited
Bivalue Universal Grave. In this construct, the Swordfish can be utilized as an extension of X-wing
elimination. The assumption of uniqueness in this construct leads to the application of locked sets in
the Unique Rectangle method. Every singleton in this construct has exactly (*) twenty buddies, eight of
which always reside in a "house." This, when completed, forms a special kind of Latin square. For 10
points, name this puzzle where the challenger must fill a nine-by-nine grid with digits so that each column,
each row, and each of the nine three-by-three sub-grids contains the digits from 1 to 9.
ANSWER: Sudoku puzzle
Shrake and Rupley introduced a rolling ball algorithm to calculate a form of this quantity applied to
biomolecules that had been developed earlier by Lee and Richards. The polar form of this quantity
should be limited to sixty square angstroms for molecules intended to cross the blood-brain barrier.
Schwarz demonstrated that different methods of approximating this quantity, unlike (*) arc length, as
using limiting polyhedra can give different values. This quantity is infinite in Gabriel's horn, and the folds
formed by the mitochondrial inner membrane exist to maximize this quantity. Its ratio to volume is
minimized for the sphere. For 10 points, name this measure of a solid, equal for a sphere to four times pi
times the radius squared.
ANSWER: surface area
For a unit hypercube of dimension d, this quantity equals two to the d minus two times d choose
two. For many shapes, the derivative of volume with respect to inradius is equal to this quantity. The
cylindrical shell method finds volume by integrating this quantity for the cylinders. This quantity
equals six times the side-length squared for a (*) cube and four pi radius-squared for a sphere. For 10
points, identify this quantity, equal to the area of all exposed faces of a figure.
ANSWER: surface area
For a parameterized region, this quantity is equal to the double integral of the square root of the
quantity one plus the squares of partial derivatives for x and y. Another formula for calculating this
quantity is equal to the double integral of the cross product of the vectors Tu and Tv over the region
D. For a cone, this quantity is pi times the radius times the quantity of the radius plus the slant height.
For a sphere, this quantity equals 4 times pi times the radius squared; for a square, this quantity is equal to
six times the side length squared. For 10 points, name this quantity equal to the exposed area of an object.
ANSWER: surface area
The solution to these objects may be represented as a determinant of a square matrix divided by another
determinant. One way to obtain a solution to them involves rewriting a matrix in reduced row echelon form.
In addition to Kramer's Rule and Gaussian Elimination, another method of solving them involves
substituting a variable for elimination. The point of intersection of their graphs is another representation of
their solution. For 10 points, give the term for a group of linear equations using the same variables.
ANSWER: systems of linear equations [prompt on linear equations]
A relation is said to possess the "anti" type of this property when it implies A and B are equal if the relation
holds for A to B and B to A. This property also gives its name to a set theory operation which takes as
inputs sets A and B, and returns the difference of elements that are found in either set, but not both sets.
This type of function, such as f = x+y, produces the same output when the order of the inputs are altered. In
linear algebra, this type of matrix is equal to its own transpose. In order for a relation to be an equivalence
relation, it must possess transitivity, reflexivity and this other property. For 10 points, name this common
mathematical property, which for a polygon, implies that an axis can be drawn through the polygon to
create two mirror images.
ANSWER: symmetric [accept word forms]
This term can describe a differential equation transformation that does not change the solutions. Emmy
Noether's first theorem states that every example of this phenomenon in a system corresponds to a
conserved quantity, and this term can be used synonymously with invariance in mathematics. This type of
relation maps y to x whenever it maps x to y, and functions of this type are classified as even or odd. This
property of equality says that if a equals b, then b equals a. Give this term that can be classified as
rotational, translational, or reflection.
ANSWER: symmetry (accept word forms such as symmetric, accept invariance before it is mentioned)
The set of all of these for a field extension has the structure of a Galois group. The coefficients of a monic
polynomial are described by elementary polynomials with this property. A physical system with this
property has a corresponding conserved quantity, according to Noether's theorem. The 17 wallpaper groups
describe this property for two-dimensional patterns like wall tilings. Odd functions have this property
relative to the origin, and even functions have it relative to the y-axis. For 10 points, name this property
whose reflective form is possessed by shapes that look the same as their mirror images.
ANSWER: symmetry or automorphism [accept word forms, prompt on permutability]
The person who developed this technique poked holes in the findings of the Lanarkshire milk
experiment. Nonparametric alternatives to this technique include the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon
signed rank test. Welch's version of this technique assumes that the two populations being compared have
unequal variance. A "paired" version of this test is often used to analyze data taken from "matched pairs"
samples. This test was first developed to measure the quality of Guinness beer by William Gosset, who
published its description under the pseudonym "Student." For 10 points, name this statistical test typically
used when the data is assumed to be normally distributed but the population mean and standard deviation
are unknown, a common alternative to a z-test.
ANSWER: Student's t-test
The caption element must be a direct child of this element, which used to be popular for web page
layout but has been superseded for that purpose by CSS with div tags. Zebra striping may be used
to make these parts of web pages easier to read. Its children, which can be grouped into thead ["T
head"], tbody ["T question"], and tfoot ["T foot"], are tr ["T R"] sections; they in turn contain th ["T

columns.
ANSWER: table tag
Asymptotes of the graph of this non-reciprocal function are separated by an interval of pi and
centered at the origin. Unlike some closely related functions, the graph of it and its reciprocal do not
have defined amplitude. The slope of a line can be found with this (*) trigonometric function. In a right
triangle, it is equal to the length of a leg opposite an angle divided by the length of the leg adjacent to the
angle. For 10 points, name this trigonometric function, the ratio of the sine and cosine functions.
ANSWER: tangent
Johann Lambert expressed this function as the continued fraction "x over one minus x-squared over three
minus x-squared," and so on. The hyperbolic type of this function is equal to "e to the two x minus one over
e to the two x plus one." The parametric equations "x equals secant of t" and "y equals this function of t"
describe an east-west opening hyperbola with semi-major and semi-minor axes of one. The Maclaurin series
for this function begins "x plus x-cubed over three plus two x to the fifth over fifteen," and this function's
derivative is secant-squared. For 10 points, name this function defined as sine over cosine, or the ratio of
opposite to adjacent sides in a right triangle.
ANSWER: tangent [accept addition of "of x" or any other variable]
The Weierstrass substitution uses a half-angle input to this function to simplify complex
trigonometric integrals to integrals of simple rational functions. The hyperbolic form of this function,
of z, is equal to the exponential of two z, minus one all over exponential of two z, plus one. The

One type of this procedure is a triply-eponymous method that counts how many times somebody from a
stronger sample beats somebody from a weaker sample, quantified as capital U. In addition to the
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney type, the Wald type of this procedure determines whether or not a parameter
exists, and the Yates type corrects the Pearson chi-square type, which, like the type that uses the Student's tdistribution, requires finding the degrees of freedom to calculate the p-value necessary to reject the null

to the adjacent edge with the lightest weight. The Chinese postman problem is a dual of this problem, and a
recent exact solution to one instance was done on a group of fifteen thousand German towns. FTP, name
this NP-hard problem that involves minimizing the path that a person takes to visit every city on a given
map.
ANSWER: Traveling Salesman Problem
The shortest superstring problem is reduced to this problem by considering overlaps between
pairs of strings. A blind method of solving this problem would search through n minus one factorial
over 2 possibilities. Dorigo originally tested his ant colony optimization method on this problem,
which can also be solved using insertion heuristics and k-opt methods. A greedy algorithm to solve
this problem simply (*) moves to the nearest neighbor with smallest weight. This NP-hard problem is the
equivalent of finding a Hamiltonian cycle on a complete weighted graph with minimum weight. For 10
points, name this optimization problem which seeks the minimum distance that the namesake figure would
have to go to visit every city on a given map exactly once.
ANSWER: travelling salesman problem [or TSP]
This problem was solved by Applegate, Bixby, Chvatal and Cook using the LKH implementation of
the Lin-Kernighan heuristic; they also created the Concorde solver, which has obtained optimal
solutions to over 100 of its namesake library of problems. Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson's cuttingplane method was the first algorithm that could solve large-scale versions of this problem, and (*) kopt is the most widely used heuristic for solving this problem. This problem has important applications in
X-ray crystallography and VLSI design, and a solution to this problem is a Hamiltonian cycle of minimum
total weight. For 10 points, name this problem which involves the namesake person finding the shortest
route through a number of cities.
ANSWER: travelling salesman problem
If the central structure of this problem is Euclidean, then the Christofides algorithm can be applied to it. The
Lin-Kernighan heuristic is used on this problem, and solutions can be improved using the 3-opt or 2-opt
algorithms, a refinement of which is simulated annealing. In general, one method to find good, if not
optimal, solutions is based on insects depositing pheromones as they walk; in addition to the ant colony
optimization, one can start with a random cycle and trade adjacent pairs. Name this NP-hard problem of
finding a minimum-total-weight Hamiltonian cycle on a weighted graph, analogized to a certain type of
person visiting many cities while going the least distance.
ANSWER: traveling salesman problem [accept shortest tour problem]
The one dimensional cutting stock problem is a special case of it and Applegate and Bixby designed
the CONCORDE program to solve it. A 3/2 approximative algorithm to solve it is the Christofides
algorithm. One heuristic often used for it is a generalization of the 2-opt and 3-opt methods, the (*)
Lin-Kernighan algorithm. Sometimes simplified by requiring the triangle inequality, it's inefficiently solved
by the nearest neighbor algorithm, and it's equivalent to finding the Hamiltonian cycle with least weight
given a complete weighted graph. For 10 points, name this NP-hard problem of finding the least cost round
trip if a namesake merchant visits each city once.
ANSWER: Traveling Salesman problem (or TSP)
The Held-Karp algorithm is a very inefficient dynamic programming way to perform this task. When the
edges of the graph in question satisfy the triangle inequality, this task can be done approximately with the
Christofides algorithm. A setup can be constructed such that the greedy approach to solving this problem,
the nearest neighbor method, is actually the worst possible. This problem seeks to find the minimum length
of a Hamiltonian cycle on a graph with given edge weights. For 10 points, identify this problem in computer
science, which asks what the shortest possible route a roving vendor can take so that he visits every city
once.

The "B" type of these objects was discovered by Rudolph Bayer, and a greedy algorithm named for
Djikstra generates the "minimum spanning" type of these objects. One special case of this data
structure with a namesake 'sort- algorithm, in which child keys are always smaller than parent keys,
is called the [*] heap. Other types of this acyclic data structure include the red/black, a self-balancing
subtype of the binary search kind, and all finite ones have exactly one root node. For 10 points, name this
data structure in computer science, whose childless nodes are known as "leaves".
ANSWER: tree
One type of these objects that can be used to determine the longest palindrome in a string is
referred to as "suffix". A version of this structure in which all the vertices are connected is a
minimum spanning one. Another variety allows each node to have a maximum of (*) two child nodes
with all nodes on the left being less than the value of the parent and all on the righter having a greater value
than the parent. That is the binary search one. For 10 points, name this data structure whose lowest nodes
are referred to as leaves.
ANSWER: trees
One type of these uses zig-zig and zig-zag steps to perform a splay operation, and a set of strings can be
stored in the radix type. The minimum element of another type can be removed in big O of log n time, a
property utilized in a namesake algorithm, the heap sort. Kruskal's algorithm finds the minimum spanning
type of this structure. The AVL and Red-Black types are self-balancing. Each node has at most two children
in the binary type, a subtype of which is very efficient to search. For 10 points, name this data structure with
a root at the top and leaves at the bottom.
ANSWER: trees [prompt on heap before mentioned] <
Lamport signatures are stored in one variety of this data structure, and another variety of this structure is
self-balancing and is called red-black. They come in hash and ordered varieties, and the number of nodes in
a complete binary one is equal to one less than two raised to the quantity h plus 1, where h is the height of
it. A complete one has all ends equidistant from the origin, and a free one lacks a first node. They have a
root node which is the parent or ancestor of all subsequent nodes. For 10 points, identify this data structure

A recently developed one of these with a good proven competitive ratio is called tango. One of these that
operates on a restricted key set with log log n performance is named after van Emde Boas (vahn EM-dah
BOH-az). The zig-zag step is one of the steps which can be used in creating the splay type of these. A set of
coloration rules are used in the red-black type, which is an example of the balanced binary search class of
these. Their topmost nodes are known as root nodes. For 10 points, name these data structures whose
terminal nodes are called leaves.
ANSWER: trees
The Huffman variety of these is integral to a common form of compression. Arne Anderson invented the
AA types of these, which are similar AVL types. Heaps are based on these, and other named types include
the Scapegoat, which has a better worst-case lookup time than the related Splay variety. The B variety
specifies how many children a node can have, and red-black ones are another type of a self-balancing form
of these. For 10 points, name this data structure, whose binary search type is self-balancing and which
consists of a root node and branches.
ANSWER: Tree
Path finding problems containing differential constraints and obstacles can be solved efficiently with the
rapidly-exploring random type of these data structures. Two-dimensional problems can be solved with the
polygonal map or point region flavors of a certain type of these objects, while Arne Andersson lends his
initials to a type of these that are similar to the 2-3 ["two three"] type. Another type of these can perform
insert and delete operations in big O of n log n time by enforcing rules on the color of nodes. A popular
form of these was invented by Rudolf Bayer and is often used for implementing databases; this is the B
variety. Self-balancing forms of a particular type of these data structures are exemplified in the AVL and
red-black types. For 10 points, name this data structure which also comes in a binary search type.
ANSWER: tree [accept Quadtree before "2-3"]
In addition to lists, these data structures that use pointers can be recursively defined. The simplest
versions are binary, but in the event that an ordered list is turned into one a heap works better. The height of
them is the maximum number of nodes that must be traversed to get to the farthest data from the root.
Pruning and grafting algorithms respectively remove and add sections to them. For 10 points, what data
structure organizes information into roots, nodes and leaves?
ANSWER: trees
A flag and two fields are necessary to perform the FindNext algorithm in the van Emde Boas version of this
structure. Galperin and Rivest invented the deletion-easy scapegoat version, and another invented by Bayer
assigns each of its subunits the two namesake colors. Frequently used are its Splay, and Red-Black varieties,
and adding a new section to it is known as "grafting."It assigns "height" and "depth" to all elements, and it
features relations between siblings, parents, and children. Forests are collections of, for 10 points, what data
structures of connected nodes?
ANSWER: trees
The AVL type of this structure requires operations to be preceded and followed by rotations, which
change the structure of these entities without changing the order of their elements, while the red-
black type of these structures are self-balancing, and can search, insert, and delete in O(log n) time.
A (*) binary type of this data structure requires that each node have at most two child nodes, with a root
node that has no parents, and leaf nodes that have no children. For ten points, name this widely used data
structure that uses linked nodes to emulate the hierarchical structure of its namesake plant.
ANSWER: Tree
The B variety of this structure forms the backbone of NTFS and btrfs [butter-eff-ess]. Red-black and
splay are binary self-balancing varieties of this data structure. Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms find
a minimum-spanning one of these structures. An example of this where all(*) children are smaller than
their parent is called a heap. They consist of nodes that point to exactly one other node. For 10 points, name
this class of undirected, acyclic, connected graphs that also name a data structure with a root, branches, and
leaves.
ANSWER: tree
Search ones of these facilitate range queries, while ones used in database engines have a very high fan-out
of around 200. One type of them can achieve amortized O(log n) ["big O of log n"] lookup; that is the selfbalancing search variety, while classical examples of these structures are typically binary. For arbitrary
graphs, Prim's Algorithm finds the minimum spanning one of these structures. Any connected graph with a
unique path between any two vertices is this type of graph. Name this type of recursive data structure in
which the number of edges is one less than the number of vertices, because they have no cycles.
ANSWER: trees
"R-" ones are used for storing spatial data based on minimum bounding rectangles. A "rotation" on
these objects increases the height of one substructure while decreasing the other; that operation is
useful for rebalancing and is carried out automatically by AVL ones. These objects can be traversed
preorder, inorder, or postorder, and rotations can be used to implement the "splay" operation that moves an
element of a namesake type of this structure to the root. Heaps are generally implemented using this data
structure, and in the average case O (log n) time is needed to search a binary one. For 10 points, name this
data structure, whose terminal nodes are called leaves.
ANSWER: trees
One type of these structures maintains rough balance when data is added or removed by using rules
involving the two namesake colors of nodes, red and black. In special varieties of these structures,
each parent element has a larger value than its children; those structures are heaps. Ones where each
node has at most two children are known as binary ones. For 10 points, name these computer science
structures that have a single root and childless leaves.
ANSWER: trees
The "dancing" type of these objects is similar to the B+ type, and is used in the Reiser filesystem. In one
type of these structures, the minimal element can be found in constant time and deleted in O(log n) ("big O
of log n") time, a property utilized in the heap sort algorithm. In another type of these structures, each entry
is assigned a color, either red or black. The AVL type is self-balancing, and in the binary type, each node
has at most two children. For 10 points, name these hierarchical data structures with root and leaf nodes, a
collection of which is called a "forest."
ANSWER: trees [prompt on heaps until it is mentioned]
The Polish notation developed by Lukasiewicz can be practically treated by representing operations by
these mathematical entities. These entities can be represented numerically by Prufer codes, and Cayley's
theorem states that for a given n, there are exactly n to the n-2 of these. The subset of those n vertices that
are pendant in on of these objects is equal to two plus the sum of the degree of each vertex minus two. The
zig, zig-zag, and zig-zig steps create the "splay" variety of these entities, while Prim's algorithm is useful
for determining the minimum spanning kind. For 10 points, identify these acyclic, connected graphs which
consist of a series of roots and leaves.
ANSWER: trees
The Day-Stout-Warren algorithm decreases the height of one type of these structures in order to
balance them. There are AVL and B types structures, while Djikstra, Prim, and Kruskal all name
algorithms that find their minimum spanning variety. The radix type of this structure stores a set of
strings such as IP addresses and another is the binary search variety. Zig-Zig and Zig-Zag are both
steps involved in generating the self-balancing splay variety, while yet another type is the Red-Black
type, which is also a self-balancing one. For 10 points, name these data structures that start at their roots and
have nodes that branch off from there until they terminate at the leaves.
ANSWER: Trees
In mathematics, these structures are undirected graphs in which any two vertices are connected by a
single path. In computer science, these structures can be searched breadth-first or depth-first. These
structures are traversed or "walked." Removing and adding sections is known, respectively, as pruning and
grafting them. For 10 points, identify these data structures that whose nodes are leaves, that are attached to
branches that meet at a root.
ANSWER: tree
Konig names a lemma laying out the conditions for which these structures are infinite. A class of
these objects named for Andersson abstract the B variety of order three. Kruskal names a theorem
about these structures, and his algorithm computes the minimum spanning variety of these
structures. They are defined as acyclic directed graphs, and one implementation as a data structure
has a big O of log of n lookup time and is named (*) binary search. Every node in these simple recursive
data structures has one parent node, except for the root. For 10 points, name this data structure whose
branches terminate at leaves.
ANSWER: Trees [accept "graph" until "Andersson"]
These structures are "graceful" according to the Ringel-Kotzig conjecture. In-order, pre-order, and postorder are ways to traverse these structures. The height of these structures can be decreased by the DSW
algorithm. Sleator and Tarjan invented a self-adjusting type of this structure that changes its shape based on
access frequency. A self-balancing type of this data structure named for two colors is quicker than the AVL
type. Solving the traveling salesman problem involves constructing the minimum spanning type of this data
structure. For 10 points, name this data structure that makes up a forest, and has terminal nodes called
leaves.
ANSWER: trees [or binary (search) trees; or red-black trees; or splay trees, etc.]
A maximum independent set for this data structure can be found in linear time by adding alternating
levels. In this structure, any two vertices or nodes must be connected by a single simple path, and
thus it is connected and acyclic. By using (*) union-find with disjoint sets, one type of this structure
containing all the vertices of a connected graph can be constructed. One variety of this data structure can be
used to easily implement a binary search. This structure also comes in red-black and self-balancing-binary

Another type of these data structures uses left-rotate and right-rotate to maintain balance following
insertions and deletions and is named for the (*) two types of nodes allowed within it. These data
structures are not arrays, but can be used to store heaps. Databases and file systems often use the "B"
variety of these data structures. The top elements in these data structures are called roots, while the bottom

ANSWER: Trees [accept more specific answers like Binary Search Trees or Red Black Trees or B-Tree s]
A common use for this data structure is storing an expression, which can be viewed using a preorder,
postorder or inorder traversal. A roughly symmetrical one is known as balanced, while a complete one is
perfect until the last level, where paths may end at different levels. One of these structures in which the left
path contains lesser values is abbreviated BST. In these structures, all elements are descendants of a root
node, while a node is either a parent to daughter nodes or a leaf. FTP, name these data structures, a
collection of which comprise a forest.
ANSWER: Binary Trees
A Tamari lattice is a poset of a type of this structure ordered with rotations, and the isometry of the AA
variety of these structures is the 2-3 type. Lookup takes O (log n) ("Big O of log n") time in the AVL type,
which is similar to a variety in which each vertex is painted one of two colors. If h is the height, at most two
to the h + 1th power minus 1 nodes are contained in the binary type of this structure, and in the red-black

whose childless nodes are known as leaf nodes, as opposed to branch nodes.
ANSWER: tree [accept binary tree before mention]
The absolute value of any cofactor of a graph's Laplacian matrix is equal to the number of a certain
type of this object. That theorem is a generalization of Cayley's theorem, which says there are n to
the n minus two of these objects on n vertices. An algorithm that uses the union-find data structure to
merge these objects in increasing order of edge weights is known as Kruskal's algorithm and, like
Prim's Algorithm, finds the (*) minimum weight one of these that spans a set of vertices. Syntax analysis
in a compiler involves the parser building one of these structures. The red-black and AVL variations of this
data structure are both self balancing binary search examples of these structures. For 10 points, name this
data structure in which each node can have a number of children and childless nodes are called leaves.
ANSWER: tree [accept minimum spanning tree or spanning tree early, accept specific types]
The symmetry group corresponding to this operation is Thompson's group F. Given two of one of the
objects that this operation acts upon representing the same set, an important open question is the existence
of a polynomial time algorithm to determine how many of these operations are required to convert one into
the other; that number is known as this operation's namesake distance. Given an n-item example of the data
structures that use this operation, deletion requires big-o of log n of these operations to maintain a log n
height bound, though insertion requires only one of these operations, at the root, to do the same. This
operation is used in the way just discussed to maintain balance in self-balancing binary trees. FTP, name
this binary tree operation in which the positions of a parent and child node are switched.
ANSWER: a tree rotation
The Heilbronn Problem is to find the set of points on the edge of a unit-area shape that maximizes the
area of the smallest of these thus formed. The construction of one of these objects is the subject of a
problem posed by Lemoine whose solution is the Kiepert hyperbola. These objects have two points defined
by a certain angle all three of which are named for Brocard. Whether or not three lines in these objects will
be concurrent can be determined using Ceva's theorem. One method of finding the area of these objects
uses the semiperimeter and side lengths and is called Hero's formula. For 10 points, name these planar
figures, the area of one of which is half its base times its height.
ANSWER: triangles
Ceva's theorem deals with lines constructed in these polygons, and Apollonius' theorem also deals with
these polygons. The Euler line of one of them passes through several significant points, including the center
of the nine-point circle. Their area can be calculated using Heron's formula. A fractal named for Sierpinski
is based on these polygons, which have centroids, orthocenters, and circumcenters. For 10 points, name
these polygons which may be scalene or equilateral.
ANSWER: triangles
The distances between an arbitrary point to one of these figures sides and vertices is given by the ErdosMordell inequality. The relationship between the sides of one of them cut by a segment is given by
Stewart's Theorem. A particular condition for collinearity in these figures is called Menelaus- Theorem,
which is the dual of Ceva's Theorem. A method of finding the area of these figures is a special case of
Bramagupta's formula, and relies on finding the difference between each side and the semiperimeter; this is
Heron's Formula. Also containing the incenter, circumcenter, and orthocenter, FTP, name these polygons
whose area can be found by the formula 1/2 times b times h.
ANSWER: Triangle (Accept 3-gon or Trigon)
The area of this polygon equals the square root of the product of the semiperimeter and the differences
between the semiperimeter and each side length according to Heron's formula. Radical three divided by
four multiplied by a side length squared equals the area for the equilateral variety of this polygon. For 10
points, name this polygon defined by three vertices and three sides.

The minimum total distance from a point to all the vertices of one of these objects is the Fermat point.
Ceva's theorem describes the condition in which lines from all of the vertices of these objects intersect at a
single point. In Euclidean geometry, the sum of the angles of one of these objects is pi radians. The area of
these objects can be found using Heron's formula, as well as the formula one half base times eight. For 10
points, name these shapes divided into scalene, isoceles, and equilateral types.
ANSWER: triangles
Napoleon's theorem concerns the use of four of these figures to construct a fifth with special properties, and
a similar method is used to locate the Fermat point for this shape. Nine significant locations on it are
traversed by the nine-point circle, the center of which lies on an Euler line in this shape. Ceva's theorem
concerning this shape states that lines drawn from a vertex to a side meet under certain conditions, and
another statement about it allows its area to be determined from side length and semiperimeter alone. For 10
points, name this simple shape, whose area is calculable by Heron's formula and whose angles add up to
180 degrees.
ANSWER: triangle
One unsolved problem in finding the number of these shapes is named for Kobon Fujimura. This
shape is commonly used to represent the first iteration of a Koch snowflake or a Sierpinski gasket.
The sequence of numbers named for this shape is generated by adding consecutive natural numbers.
The area of one of these shapes can be computed using Heron's formula, and its side lengths and
angle measures can be found using the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines. Two of these can be proved
to be similar by showing that two corresponding angles are congruent. Name these shapes whose
interior angles add up to 180 degrees and which have three vertices.

Kimberling has catalogued over three thousand centers of this shape, some of which include the
Nagel point and the nine-point center. Kimberling center X1 refers to the point at which the angular

eight degrees and has three sides.
ANSWER: triangle
One point on these figures can be determined by drawing lines from extouch points to vertices; that point is
the Nagel point. One formula describing these figures is a special case of Brahmagupta's Formula where
one side is set to zero. Whether points lying on the sides of one of these figures are collinear can be
determined by Menelaus- Theorem, which is paired with Ceva's Theorem. The Euler line passes through
several points on one of these that isn-t a regular polygon. The semiperimeter of one of these figures may be
used to calculate the area in Hero's formula, though it may be easier to use one half times base times height.
Name this polygon that has three sides.
ANSWER: triangles
The Euler line passes through several distinctive points of one of these objects, while Ceva's
theorem also applies to these objects. The area of one of these objects can be found by taking the
square root of the (*) semi-perimeter times the difference of the semi-perimeter minus each side. That
calculation is known as Heron's formula. A nine point circle can be drawn around one of the objects while
the laws of sines and cosines also apply to these objects. For 10 points, name this polygon whose "right"
variety conforms to the Pythagorean Theorem.
ANSWER: triangles
The Erdos [EHR-dish]-Mordell inequality applies to these entities, and in one of these, the Nagel point is
the isotomic conjugate of the Gergonne point. Kimberling also cataloged the Spieker center and the
Feuerbach point for one of these. The de Longchamps point for one lies on the Euler line, along with the
nine point center, orthocenter, and circumcenter. Their area can be calculated using Heron's formula, and in
non-Euclidean geometries, the sum of their angles differs from the usual 180 degrees. In ones with a right

The group of symmetries of a regular one of these is isomorphic to the smallest non-Abelian group.
Thales's theorem describes the angles of these polygons when inscribed in a circle. Three of the platonic
solids have these as faces. When a norm is applied to vectors that form the edges of one of these, the norms
must satisfy this object's namesake inequality. A special case of Brahmagupta's formula named for Heron

which come in scalene and isosceles varieties.
ANSWER: triangles
Ceva's theorem governs concurrency of cevians in these shapes, and nine specific points derived from
one of these shapes lie on the same circle. With respect to one of these shapes, Euler's line contains de
Longchamps point, the center of the circumscribed circle, the centroid, and the orthocenter. The area
of one of these shapes is the square root of four specific terms involving the semiperimeter according to
Heron's formula, and the Pythagorean formula is used to find the hypotenuse of the right type of these
shapes. For 10 points, name these three-sided polygons.
ANSWER: triangles
Thales's (THAY-leez's) theorem describes this shape inscribed in a circle, with one side as a diameter to
the circle. According to the exterior angle theorem, any exterior angle of this shape is greater than any
remote interior angle. Two of these shapes may not be congruent in the ambiguous case, but they are
congruent if they have side-angle-side or angle-side-angle equivalence. They can have at most one obtuse
angle, since their internal angles sum to 180 degrees. For 10 points, name this polygon with three sides.
ANSWER: triangle
Each of these figures corresponds to an extouch version. A theorem relating the length of a segment in one
of these figures to its side lengths is named for Apollonius, while ratios involving a directed
line through this figure multiply to give negative one according to Menelaus- Theorem. Their areas can be
calculated using Heron's Formula, and attempts to solve these figures can lead to the ambiguous case,
though they often can be solved based on knowing two sides and an angle. Name these shapes whose
interior angles add up to one hundred eighty degrees.
ANSWER: triangle
One important point in this figure can be found by taking the isotomic conjugate of the Gergonne
point; that point is the Nagel point. The Euler line connects the center of the nine-point circle, the (*)
circumcenter, the orthocenter, and the centroid, and this figure's angles always add up to 180 degrees.
Acute, obtuse, and right are varieties of, for ten points, what three-sided geometrical figure?

According to Turan's Theorem, one of these entities is necessarily formed if four times the number of
edges in a graph is greater than the number of vertices squared. Every two-coloring on a complete 6graph forms two monochrome examples of these entities. Three lines concur in one of these figures if
the conditions for Ceva's ["CHAY-va-s] Theorem are met, and the areas of these figures can be
found using (*) Heron's formula. The laws of sines and cosines hold true for these shapes, whose areas are
equal to base times height over two. For ten points, name these three-sided figures, which come in
equilateral and isosceles varieties.

Two of these polygons are the subjects of Pedoe's inequality, for which equality obtains only when
the two polygons are similar. The unique ellipse that can be inscribed in one of these polygons is
named for Jakob Steiner. Their side lengths are related to the length of another line segment by (*)
Stewart's theorem, while a theorem giving a concurrency condition for certain lines in this shape is named
for Giovanni Ceva. The area of this polygon is given by Hero's formula, and the laws of sines and cosines
describe this kind of shape. For 10 points, name this polygon whose interior angles sum to one hundred
eighty degrees and that has three sides.
ANSWER: triangles [accept three-sided polygon or other equivalent complete definitions before mention]
Half the sum of the side lengths times the inradius gives this quantity. This value is equal to half the
product of two side lengths with the sine of the opposite angle. It is also given by the square root of
the (*) semiperimeter times the difference between the semiperimeter and each side, which is called
Heron's formula. The most common formula to find this value uses an altitude of the shape. For 10 points,
name this quantity equal to one-half base times height.
ANSWER: area of a triangle (both parts required; prompt on area; accept logical equivalents including both underlined parts)
This theorem is reversed in Minkowski space, and in Euclidean geometry it is sometimes confused with a
statement involving inner products which can be used to prove it. When applied to vectors, this theorem is
equivalent to the statement that the sum of the lengths of two vectors is greater than the length of the sum of
two vectors. Simplistically, it guarantees that there are no shortcuts between two points in space, that
instead the shortest path between two points is a straight line. This theorem can be used to show that the
number of non-congruent three-sided figures with integer side lengths and perimeter less than five is one.
Name this statement, sometimes confused with the Cauchy-Schwarz (koh-SHEE SHWARZ) inequality, that
the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a three-sided figure must be larger than the third side.
ANSWER: triangle inequality [accept answers augmented by anything similar to "theorem" or "rule"]
This statement is used to prove that the packing number is equal to or less than the intrinsic
covering number. Along with non-negativity, the identity of discernibles and symmetry, metric
functions on topological spaces must satisfy this statement. This statement was extended to L-p
spaces by Minkowski. Assuming that the inner product is a norm in an inner product space allows
the derivation of this statement from the (*) Cauchy-Schwarz theorem. For polygons with ninety degree
angles in them, this statement is a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem. For 10 points, the sum of the
lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side of the namesake polygon
according to what inequality?
ANSWER: triangle inequality [accept Cauchy-Schwarz inequality until mentioned]
The generalization of this statement to Lp spaces is called the Minkowski inequality, and this
statement is reversed in Minkowski spaces. Part of the definition of a metric space is that the metric
obeys commutativity and this other statement, and this statement is used to define the norm of a
vector space. It can be proven by reduction from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on an inner product
space, or by considering the Law of Cosines and (*) removing the cosine term. This statement can be
used to show that the shortest distance between two points in Euclidian space is a straight line. For 10
points, name this inequality, which states that the sum of the lengths of two sides of the namesake figure is
greater than the length of the third side.
ANSWER: triangle inequality [prompt on "Cauchy-Schwarz inequality" due to ambiguities]
The p-adic numbers satisfy a strong version of this statement, and a reversed form of it holds for non-
positive definite metric spaces, such as a Minkowski space. A more general version of this statement was
discovered by Bunyakovsky in its integral form. It is not obeyed by the L-0 norm, but it is a special case of
the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality for the Euclidian norm. For 10 points, identify this statement, also known
as subadditivity, which says that the length of any side of an eponymous shape must be less than or equal to
the sum of the other two sides.
ANSWER: Triangle Inequality [prompt on Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality before mentioned]
One generalization of this statement provides bounds in the Absolute
Convergence Theorem. A positive-definite symmetric function satisfying this
condition is called a metric. This statement for inner products is a direct
result of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. One version of this theorem is that
the absolute value of a sum is(*) at most the sum of the absolute valuesm, and this
theorem implies that the shortest path between two points is a straight line. For ten points,
name this inequality which states that the sum of the lengths of the shorter two sides is
larger than the longest side of its namesake polygon.
ANSWER: triangle inequality
One method accomplishing this task marks two parallel lines above a ray, creating equal spaces,
then folds the paper they are on so that a corner touches the middle line. Another method for this
task uses a semicircle with two perpendicular segments called a tomahawk. Using classical tools, it
can be approximated by infinitely alternating sides with a process that involves drawing three arcs.
The function four x cubed minus three x equals a constant is used to determine whether the classical
version of this task can be done. That equation was used by Pierre Wantzel to prove that this task,
like (*) doubling the cube, is impossible using only a straightedge-and-compass. Identify this task that
involves dividing the space between rays into a certain number of equal parts.

The axiom of this concept states that for any set there exists a set whose elements are the elements of the
elements of the first set. The unsorted and usual types of this operation remove repetition from a list, while
the discriminated or disjoint type of this create an index giving information about the source of each
element. The symmetric difference gives a subset of the result of this operation. When this operation is
applied to two sets, the resulting cardinality is at least the higher cardinality of the two original sets and at
most the sum of the cardinalities. The inclusion-exclusion principle states that the cardinality of this is the
sum of the cardinalities of the inputs, minus the cardinality of the intersection. Name this operation that
gives all the elements that are in either or both of the two input sets.

The keyword auto is used with these things. These things can be passed to functions using the strategies
call-by-value or call-by-reference. Camel case and Hungarian notation are two ways to name these things.
When they are only available inside certain functions, instead of globally, their scope is said to be local.
Statically typed languages require that these things have their type identified when they are declared; those
types include int and float. Identify these storage locations for data that have a symbolic name.

outside of its scope. Static ones extend across the lifetime of a program. Although they are not
functions, many languages require that the (*) data type of these things be specified when they are
declared. For 10 points, identify these symbols associated with a storage location that stand in for values in
a computer program.
ANSWER: variables
The Bienayme [byen-ae-may] formula states that two values of this quantity can be added to find the new
value when two uncorrelated random variables are added or subtracted. In the central limit theorem, this
variable is divided by the number of samples. This quantity is equal to the expected value of the quantity
variable squared, end quantity, minus the expected value squared. In a Poisson [pwie-sone] distribution, this
quantity equals the expected value. The units of this quantity are found by squaring the units of the variable.
Name this measure of spread whose square root equals standard deviation.
ANSWER: variance
In factor analysis, the sum of the squares of the common factor loadings for a variable, or communality,
is how much of this value is shared with other variables. An assumption about the homogeneity of this
measure can be evaluated using Hartley's F-max test. This measure is conventionally defined as the
expected value of the square of a random variable minus the square of the expected value of a random
variable, or the second moment of the distribution minus the square of the mean. The coefficient of
determination, or R2, is the percentage of this value for one variable that is accounted for by this value for
another variable. For 10 points, identify this statistical measure represented by sigma squared that is the
square of standard deviation.
ANSWER: variance
The square of this quantity is used in the denominator of classical calculations of kurtosis, which is
supposed to measure the peakedness of a distribution, and this quantity is known as the second moment
about the mean. In a Poisson (pwah-SOHN) distribution, this quantity is equal to the mean. For a set of
numbers, this quantity is equal to the expected value of the squares of the numbers minus the square of the
expected values. If all of the numbers in a list are multiplied by a constant, this quantity gets multiplied by
that factor squared. Name this quantity, the average of the squares of the deviations, whose square root
equals the standard deviation.

A set of these objects is the input to the Gram-Schmidt process. A set of these objects can be a "basis" if
all elements of the set are linearly independent. In Cartesian (car-TEE-shun) space, i, j, and k are used to
represent the "unit" variety of these objects. They can be thought of as one-dimensional matrices
(MAY-truh-sees), and the dot product and cross product are defined over these objects. For 10 points, name
these mathematical objects that consist of a magnitude and a direction and are contrasted with scalars.
ANSWER: vectors [or linearly-independent vectors; prompt on matrices before it is read]
This description is applied to bosons with a spin of 1, since their spin states transform like one of these
things. One class of these objects is classified as either spacelike, timelike, or null. One operation on one of
these things is set equal to zero in Gauss's law for magnetism; that operation is called "divergence", or "del
dot". A basis for these things is typically denoted "i hat, j hat, k hat" in rectangular coordinates. The cross
product of two of these things yields another one of these things, and addition on them is performed "tip to
tail". For 10 points, give this name for a mathematical object with a magnitude and a direction, often
expressed as tuples of scalars.
ANSWER: vectors [or vector fields; or three-vectors; accept four-vectors; accept unit vectors]
In x86, a table of these of interrupts is stored starting at address zero. In the Flynn classification, the
instructions operating on these are of the SIMD type. In the C++ STL, the class by this name is essentially
a dynamic array. This type of graphics is contrasted to raster or bitmaps images and the standard for this
type of graphics is called SVG. For 10 points, name this word that also describes mathematical entities that
have direction and magnitude, thus contrasting with scalars.
ANSWER: vectors
In distributed systems, this type of clock is an array of logical clocks passed between the processes.
Cortes and Vapnik first created a way of orienting a hyperplane to maximize the margin,
implementing a binary linear classifier referred to as "machines" of this type. SIMD instructions are
usually used to operate on data in these data structures. In C++, this is a template for a dynamic
sequence that can efficiently add or remove elements (*) only from its end. They are used to define paths
in the EPS and SVG formats, allowing them to be scaled without losing quality, thus naming a type of
graphics contrasted with raster graphics. For 10 points, identify this computer science term often applied to
one-dimensional arrays.

Performing the triple product on three of these entities gives the volume of a parallelepiped. The
right hand rule can be used when performing an operation on them, and these entities can be added

points, name these mathematical entities that have both magnitude and direction and are contrasted with
scalars.
ANSWER: vectors
The set of these mathematical entities defining a space is called a "basis." These entities can be treated
as rank one tensors or as one-dimensional matrices. Two of these are orthogonal when their product is 0.
Operations performed on these objects include the dot product and cross product. For 10 points, name these
mathematical objects that have both magnitude and direction and are contrasted with scalars.
ANSWER: vectors
The Gram-Schmidt process applies a series of projections to these objects. A certain operation on three of
these gives the volume of a parallelepiped. One operation on these objects is anti-commutative, and two of
these are orthogonal if another operation yields zero; those operations are the cross and dot products.

parallelogram. Contrasted with scalars, for 10 points, name these mathematical objects that have both
magnitude and direction.

One of these objects is coordinate system invariant if its components contra-vary with the change of
basis. Three of them form the standard basis for a three-dimensional Euclidean space. They can be added
using the parallelogram rule, and the right-hand rule is used to determine the direction of the cross product
of two of them. They also have a dot product, the result of which is a scalar. For 10 points, name these
objects which have both magnitude and direction.
ANSWER: vectors
In the Frenet-Serret [freh-nay sair-ay] formulas, a matrix containing curvature and torsion is multiplied by a
matrix containing three of these, the last of which is the binormal [bye-NOR-mul]. The binormal type is
found by using the tangent and normal types. The spaces named after these are defined by a basis consisting
of a set of them. These can be normalized by dividing them by their length, resulting in one of these that has
a magnitude of one. These are used to represent several basic physical quantities such as force, velocity, and
displacement. Name these structures that have a magnitude and direction, often contrasted with scalars.
ANSWER: vectors
In mathematics, spaces associated with these objects are modules over a field, and may have inner products.
In computer programming, these are C++ data structures which function as dynamic arrays. The subset of
computer graphics named after these objects uses mathematical primitives to render objects, while in
biology they are hosts which carry and transmit an infectious agent. Impulse, momentum, and force, but not
speed are physical examples of, for ten points, these objects, which in mathematics commonly have both
direction and magnitude and may be drawn as arrows.
ANSWER: vectors
The quotient of these constructs can be defined using quaternions (kwa-TER-nee-uhns), and a linearly
independent collection of these objects that spans a space forms a basis. These have tensor rank one, and
operators named after these-also called differential operators-are represented by the del symbol. A triple
product combining three of these is used to find the volume of a parallelepiped (paar-uh-LEL-luh-pai-ped);
that triple product combines the two common methods of their multiplication, one of which is
anticommutative and the other of which outputs a real number. Name these entities combined using dot or
cross products, which represent a magnitude and a direction.
ANSWER: vectors
In the study of graphics, an object with this name functions as the complement to a raster. The CauchSchwarz inequality concerns the multiplication of two of these objects. The triangle inequality concerns the
addition of these objects. These objects sum is found by the parallelogram rule. These generalizations of
numbers are the inputs of a cross product and a dot product, and many of them feature x,y, and z
components. For 10 points, name these quantities with a magnitude and direction, distinguished from
scalars.
ANSWER: vectors
Four-dimensional versions of these objects make up a Minkowski space. The parallelogram rule is used
for adding these objects. One operation involving them is only valid in three or seven dimensions, and
another operation involving them uses the product of the lengths of two of them and the cosine of the angle
between them. Those operations are the cross product and the dot product. For 10 points, name these
objects which have both magnitude and direction, unlike scalars.
ANSWER: vectors
According to one theorem, the Radon-Hurwitz numbers govern how many of these that are non-zero
can be mapped to an n-sphere. For a Riemannian metric, critical points are where these vanish when
mapped from a smooth function. For a symplectic manifold, one can define the Hamiltonian type of
these constructs from an energy function. It is impossible to define a continuous and non-zero one of
these constructs tangent to an even dimensional (*) n-sphere according to the hairy ball theorem. Ones
with vanishing curl are said to be irrotational and conservative; such ones can be derived by taking the
gradient of a scalar potential function. For 10 points, name these topological constructs that assign a length

This mathematical construction when of order seven can be drawn in a rosette figure called "Victoria". The
version of order three can be constructed with circles so that the central region is a Reuleaux triangle. In

Denali makes use of a process termed para this to run x86 architecture on certain machines advanced by
Popek and Goldberg. Examples of those machines described by this adjective include Java Runtime
Environment, which sends commands and receives outputs from the Java software, and the memory of this

combined with reality means a world that exists only within a computer.
ANSWER: virtual
Fred Cohen proved in 1984 that no algorithm exists to detect these entities. Veith Risak created an
assembly language variant of this entity that was based on theories put for in a 1966 paper by John von
Neumann. That paper introduced the theory of self-replicating automata. In the 1980s, a proof-of-concept
version of this entity notably displayed the message "catch me if you can!" In addition to "Creeper", a more

This programming language originated as a drag-and-drop shell prototype called Tripod, which did not
feature a programmable language. The company that now owns it bought Tripod from its designer, added a
simple language, and renamed it Ruby and later Thunder, the direct predecessor to this language. The
heading of a method in this language may include Sub or Function after the more standard Public and
Private. For loops are declared using the keywords "For" and "To," or alternatively "For Each," and "If"

With an Italian, this mathematician names the result that the image of a subset of a complex plane under
a function with an essential singularity in that subset will be dense in the complex plane. This
non-American mathematician partially names a theorem which states that every continuous function on a
closed interval can be uniformly approximated, arbitrarily closely, by a polynomial. He is the second
namesake of a theorem stating that a bounded and closed subset of R-n is sequentially compact. He used
the concept of uniform convergence to create the rigorous definition of continuity and revised Cauchy's

This person and Richard Taylor co-authored the article "Ring-Theoretic Properties of Certain Hecke
[HECK-eh] Algebras." Helped by a paper on the Eisenstein ideal by Barry Mazur [MAY-zur], this person
matched modular forms to elliptic curves. That work was noteworthy because of a proof of the epsilon

The n-sample location test can be built up as a series of tests of this type because the one-sample
location test is always exactly of this type. A priori, this procedure requires knowledge of the
population variance, an assumption relaxed in a similar procedure in which the central statistic is
different by a factor of root sample size from the central statistic in this test. The statistic central to
this test is equal to the sample mean minus the assumed true mean all over the standard deviation; it
is used as a parameter in the standard normal cdf to generate a p value, the probability that the (*)
null hypothesis holds. For 10 points, name this simplest type of statistical test that is similar to the more
general t-test.
ANSWER: a z-test [prompt on significance test before "population variance"]
Bolzano's Theorem guarantees that this value is output by certain continuous functions. Rolle's Theorem
assumes that this number is the difference in the function values at the endpoints and concludes that the
derivative at some point is equal to this number. Newton's Method can be used to find points where a
function takes this value. This real number divided by itself creates an indeterminate form, in which case
L'Hopital's Rule can be used. In a definition of a derivative, h approaches this value. Local extrema occur
where a function's derivative is equal to this number. For ten points, name this number that is the slope of a
horizontal line.

The Grothendieck pretopology named after this value posits the existence of fibered products. The
separation axiom named after this value holds for a topological space if for all pairs of distinct points,
there exists an open set containing one but not the other. That separation axiom is sometimes named
after Kolmogorov. The sphere S2 and the disc both have this genus and Euler characteristic. All
countable sets have a (*) Hausdorff Dimension equal to this value. For a well-defined metric function to
be equal to this value, both of the inputs must be the same element of the topological space. This value is
also the dimension of a point. For 10 points, identify this value, which when added to a number equals said
number.

This many odd perfect numbers have currently been discovered, and it is the value of the
determinant of a singular matrix. This is the probability of two mutually exclusive events occurring.
This number is its own (*) additive inverse, but it has no multiplicative inverse, because it is impossible to
divide by this number. This number is contained in the set of whole numbers but not in the set of natural
numbers. For ten points, what is this neither positive nor negative number which is equal to four minus
four?
ANSWER: zero (or additive identity before mention)
In the set-theory construction of the natural numbers, this number is a subset of all other natural

forbidden.
ANSWER: zero [or the empty set until "roots of unity" is read]
This property does not hold in the rings of integers modulo a composite number, and whether it holds
distinguishes integral domains with respect to rings. A short proof by contradiction of this property consists
of multiplying both sides of an equation by the multiplicative inverse of any factor on one side of the

zero.
ANSWER: zero product property [accept logical equivalents for "property"; accept answers logically equivalent to nonexistence of zero divisors]
In the Bellare-Rogaway formulation of these techniques, which employs the random oracle model, it
can be completed in a single round because deniability does not exist; in the standard model, oneround protocols are only possible for languages in BPP. Languages for which "Las Vegas", or
perfectly-sound versions of this protocol exist are necessarily in RP, as are languages for which there
exists a deterministic verifier. This protocol was first applied to the problem of identifying quadratic
